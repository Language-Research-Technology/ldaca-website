      <description>by Teresa ChanDuring a Master of Applied Linguistics degree at UNSW Sydney, I was given the opportunity to enrol in a course in which students become interns in the School of Humanities and Languages&amp;rsquo; Language Processing Lab. Although I would still have readings and assessments to complete, the teaching model would be different to a standard postgraduate course: I would attend regular online lab meetings with my supervisor and other interns, and design and conduct my own research project.</description>

      <description>by Rosanna SmithFounded in Sydney in 1996, Appen is a technology company that collects and improves data for the purposes of training and developing machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. During my time at Appen, a significant part of my work involved a diverse range of projects for both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, including phonetic transcription, grapheme-to-phoneme or letter-to-sound (L2S) rule development, and part-of-speech (POS) annotation.</description>

      <description>by Harriet SheppardHarriet on an outrigger boat off VanatɨnaImage Source: Harriet Sheppard My fieldwork experience, in many ways, conforms to stereotypes of language fieldwork – a community outsider working with a smaller language community located far from an urban centre. For my postgraduate research, I documented and described grammatical topics of Sudest (known as Vanga Vanatɨna by its speakers), an Oceanic language spoken in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The language is spoken on the islands of Vanatinai (also known as Sudest and Tagula) and Yeina in the Louisiade Archipelago, approximately 350 kilometres southeast of the PNG mainland.</description>
