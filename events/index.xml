Forthcoming workshops Workshop on immigrant language corpora in Australia Australia has long been seen as one of the worldâ€™s most multilingual and multicultural societies, with more than 490 languages coming from around 300 ancestries and cultural traditions (ABS, 2021, 2022).

Workshop on Data Migration Skills The Language Data Commons of Australia infrastructure is based on widely-accepted standards such as Research Object Crates (RO-Crate) and the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). The project has been running for almost two years and the processes and tools for aligning data with these standards are now well-developed. This workshop aimedto show the application of those tools to data in a variety of formats to efficiently migrate material to the LDaCA standards.</description></item></channel></rss>
