This work is taking place in the context of the Australian Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons, particularly the Language Data component thereof and the long-established PARADISEC cultural archive. The standards used include the Oxford Common File Layout for storage, Research Object CRATE (RO-Crate) for consistent linked-data description of FAIR digital objects, and a language data metadata profile to ensure long-term interoperability between systems and re-usability over time. We also discuss data licensing and authorization for access to non-open resources. We suggest that the approach shown here may be used in other disciplines or for other kinds of digital library, repository or archival systems.</p><p>*The submitted abstract did not have the word data here - added for clarity</p><p>By: Peter Sefton (University of Queensland), Simon Musgrave (University of Queensland & Monash University) & Nick Thieberger (University of Melbourne)</p><section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide"><img src=Slide01.png alt='The Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) and Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) projects received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP768 and https://doi.org/10.47486/PL074) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC).

This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.</p><p>The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions.</p><p>We would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands on which we live and work and the importance of indigenous knowledge, culture and language to the these projects.

In March this year, <a href=https://bibwild.wordpress.com/2023/03/21/ocfl-and-source-of-truth-two-options/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">this blog post was published</a> - looking at the pros and cons of using OCFL (the Oxford Common File Layout) as the “source of truth” for a system (say a repository).</p><p>We are very much taking the OCFL (that is file-in-storage-as-the-source-of-truth) approach in LDaCA. Which begs the question: “But doesn’t that mean that it’s very specific to language data?” No, because we’re using a very flexible, extensible, discipline-neutral format for data description – yes, we have ways to specialise metadata and interfaces to language and other cultural metadata, but NO, the systems are not locked-in to that mode of operation. This means we should be able to share development and maintenance more broadly than with a single archive.</p><p>Two main points we want to get across in this presentation:</p><ul><li>We are taking seriously the idea that data-in-storage should be “batteries included” – everything needed to preserve and use the data is stored together and systems can be reconstituted from this storage.</li><li>This approach IS generic – different vocabularies / schemas can be plugged-in by design.</li></ul></section><section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide"><img src=Slide11.png alt='📂  🔬 🔭 📹 💽 🖥️ ⚙️🎼🌡️🔮🎙️🔍🌏📡💉🏥💊🌪️ ' title='Slide: 11' border=1 width=85%%><p>So lets now start looking at the standards involved in the Arkisto approach.

This a big step for eresearch systems – no longer is there a transformation step on data onboarding (we used the term ingest, but some project members and partners found the metaphor distasteful).</p></section><section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide"><img src=Slide13.png alt='  Here the mechanism is to use the ‘magic’ name METS.xml to store some extra metadata – with a fully linked-data system this kind of thing is not needed ' title='Slide: 13' border=1 width=85%%><p>This screenshot is a bit of (undated) DSpace documentation found following a tip from Kim Sheppard – we have included it here to illustrate that storing additional metadata (in this case METS) for an object was done by convention. Using a linked-data system means that we no longer have to do this kind of thing – there’s still one magic file name in RO-Crate but it’s only one for the metadata and one for the HTML preview – everything else is labelled and extensible.</p></section><section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide"><img src=Slide14.png alt='Using this core layer gives you interoperability with generic tools and general purpose “Who What Where” metadata ' title='Slide: 14' border=1 width=85%%><p>In the early days of the “Open Repositories” movement repositories had Dublin Core metadata (a standard with a few different flavours).</p></section><section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide"><img src=Slide15.png alt=' Using a domain specific profile extends the core RO-Crate for a specific type of data – eg language data, computational workflows or “cultural collections”  (You can use more than one profile) ' title='Slide: 15' border=1 width=85%%><p>These days using linked data it is no longer necessary to have a bevy of XML schemas with incompatible encodings to store data from different schemas, different voclabularies and ontologies can co-exist and be expressed in a common way.</p></section><section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide"><img src=Slide16.png alt title='Slide: 16' border=1 width=85%%><p>In the PARADISEC system this is achieved by storing files on disk in a simple hierarchy - with metadata and other resources stored together in a directory - this scheme allows for hands-on management of data resources, independently of the software used to serve them.</p><p>This approach means that if the PARADISEC software-stack becomes un-maintainable for financial or technical reasons the important resources, the data, are stored safely on disk with their metadata and a new access portal could be constructed relatively easily.</p><p>Despite the valuable features of this solution, it is not generalisable. The metadata.xml is custom to PARADISEC, as is the software stack.</p><p>In 2019 PARADISEC and the eResearch team at UTS received small grants from the Australian National Data Service and began collaborating on an approach to managing archival repositories which built on this PARADISEC approach of storing metadata with data.</p><p>The UTS team presented on this at <a href=https://ptsefton.com/2019/11/05/FAIR%20Repo%20-%20eResearch%20Presentation/index.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">eResearch Australasia 2019</a></p></section><section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide"><img src=Slide17.png alt='  ' title='Slide: 17' border=1 width=85%%><p>The <a href=https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/structure.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">structure of an RO-Crate</a> is very similar to the PARADISEC example above, but with a json file instead of XML, and an optional preview in HTML.</p><p>RO-Crate has a growing number of <a href=https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/tools/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">tools and software libraries</a> which means that a team such as PARADISEC does not have to maintain their own bespoke software.</p></section><section typeof="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide"><img src=Slide18.png alt='  ' title='Slide: 18' border=1 width=85%%><p>Here, for comparison is <a href=https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/FEDORA6x/Fedora+OCFL+Object+Structure#FedoraOCFLObjectStructure-FedoraAtomicResource-Container target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">how Fedora 6 would store an object (an Atomic Resource in Fedora-speak) like this with multiple files</a>.

By using an extensible metadata standard with a growing community, and a storage-layer standard forged from an acquired aversion to systems migration we aim to reduce the risk to very important cultural data by working with as many communities as possible on software tools, so that we reduce cost and risk for all of us.</p></section></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>Updated on 2023-06-29</span></div></div><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-md></div><div class=post-info-share><span><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Twitter" data-sharer=twitter data-url=https://www.ldaca.edu.au/posts/arkisto-stack-or-2023/ data-title="Towards a Generic Research Data Commons: A highly scalable standard-based repository framework for Language and other Humanities data
