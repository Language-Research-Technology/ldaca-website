Data on an Arkisto deployment is always available on disc (or {{< glossary_link display="object" id="object" >}} storage) with a complete description independently of any services such as websites or {{< glossary_link display="APIs" id="api" >}}. Once the data is safe and well-described, Arkisto has a flexible model for how data can be accessed using a variety of services. Built on top of {{< glossary_link display="RO-Crate" id="ro-crate" >}} and {{< glossary_link display="OCFL" id="ocfl" >}}.'
