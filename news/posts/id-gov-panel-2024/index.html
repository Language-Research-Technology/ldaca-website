This event brought together a panel of three speakers — Lesley Acres (<a href=https://www.library.uq.edu.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">UQ Library</a>), Dr Rose Barrowcliffe (<a href=https://www.mq.edu.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Macquarie University</a> and LDaCA) and Robert McLellan (UQ and LDaCA). The discussion was facilitated by Grant Sarra.</p><br><blockquote><p><strong><em>Rose Barrowcliffe</em></strong> <em>is Butchulla and is a post-doctoral research fellow at Macquarie University and an Honorary Senior Research Fellow at UQ. Rose&rsquo;s research examines the representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in archives, and her postdoc specifically focusses on embedding Indigenous perspectives in metadata to support discoverability and access of records for Indigenous peoples. Rose is a Chief Investigator on the LDaCA project.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>Robert dhurwain McLellan</em></strong> <em>is a proud Gooreng Gooreng descendant of the Wide Bay region. He is a community researcher, an experienced Director, governance and engagement practitioner and is Program Manager for LDaCA at UQ. Robert is a strong advocate for truth telling and speaking up for Aboriginal peoples&rsquo; rights and justice, economic advancement, and to ensure First Nations voices are authentically valued and embraced across all levels of society. He is passionate about revitalising Indigenous languages and building culturally inclusive, honourable and cohesive communities.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>Lesley Acres</em></strong> <em>is a descendent of the Bidjara, Kairi tribes and Badugal people, Badu Island, Torres Strait Islands and she currently works with UQ Library as a Manager (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Collections and Services). She worked at the <a href=https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">State Library of Queensland</a> Indigenous Services for nine years, where she supported the operation and establishment of a network of Indigenous Knowledge Centres across Queensland, and has some 27 years&rsquo; experience working at different levels of government in a wide range of Indigenous affairs.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>Grant Sarra</em></strong> <em>is a proud descendant of the Gooreng Gooreng people through his mother and a first-generation Italian through his father. As a highly strategic and analytical cultural leader, Grant has played a key role in designing and developing large-scale social and economic enterprises across Australia. His work has led to increased self-determination, operational success and substantial additional funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and communities.</em></p></blockquote><br><p>The panellists explored topics of data accessibility and discoverability, <a href=https://www.terrijanke.com.au/icip target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property</a> (ICIP), and tools and <a href=/resources/glossary/#methods title="Procedures, processes or techniques which can be systematically and repetitively used to achieve a particular goal." target=_blank>methods</a> for Indigenous Data Governance (ID-Gov). What follows is a summarised version of the panellists&rsquo; contributions organised around the main themes of the discussion.<sup><a name=back-1><a href=#fn-1 rel>1</a></a></sup> Key takeaways for Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) sector workers looking to implement ID-Gov strategies in their <a href=/resources/glossary/#collection title="A group of related Objects." target=_blank>collections</a> were the importance of employing First Nations staff and working in respectful partnership with communities.</p><br><h2 id=supporting-community-access-to-data>Supporting community access to data</h2><p>The structural barriers for Indigenous communities accessing their archival materials are many. Rose Barrowcliffe (Figure 2) reflected on these challenges, describing her entry into the archival sector:</p><ul><i>I came into that space from my own personal experience of trying to access archival records that were about my Country, that were in an archive. The archive specifically was about my Country, and it was named using our language name of all things, yet we were told it wasn't really relevant to us. It was owned and managed by an institution.</i> (RB)</ul><p>Rose went on to say that negative experiences of accessing materials held in large collecting institutions are common in communities and identified two critical challenges for community access.</p><p>Firstly, most collecting institutions facilitate access to materials through slow, analogue processes. If used appropriately, however, new technologies and machine learning offer exciting opportunities for institutions to support discoverability and access in ways that have not been possible before. Of course, implementing these changes requires collecting institutions to be resourced for this kind of work, which should be done in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</p><p>Secondly, some collecting institutions carry a misunderstanding of &lsquo;Indigenous data&rsquo;. <a href=https://ardc.edu.au/resource/indigenous-data/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Indigenous data</a> is expansive and includes all data by, about or for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It includes data collected, used or stored by any agency, department, laboratory, organisation, corporation, statutory body, university or research institute conducted by, with and about Indigenous peoples, communities or their Country, and data that Indigenous communities have generated and maintained themselves. Embracing this definition requires structural change and a &rsquo;letting go&rsquo; of some of the control which collecting institutions are constructed around.</p><p>A fuller understanding of Indigenous data opens up better pathways to recognise ICIP within collections. ICIP asserts that the authority for knowledge should remain with the original creators and holders of that knowledge.</p><ul><i>Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property reasserts the authority of Indigenous people to say, "It actually doesn't matter where that knowledge sits and what form it takes, the knowledge and authority for that knowledge always remains with the Indigenous people that that has come from."</i> (RB)</ul><p>Importantly, Rose added that collecting institutions who engage with ICIP are better equipped to build frameworks for ID-Gov.</p><br><body><div><img src=/data-governance-panel/DSC_5619.jpg alt="Rose Barrowcliffe speaks on the panel." title=Rose style=width:auto;height:400px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 2: Dr Rose Barrowcliffe.</b><br>Image Source: Lewis James Bin Doraho</div></div></body><br><h2 id=strategies-for-implementing-indigenous-data-governance>Strategies for implementing Indigenous Data Governance</h2><p>Indigenous Data Sovereignty (ID-Sov) and ID-Gov are terms sometimes used interchangeably in the Australian public sector. Robert McLellan (Figure 3) sees ID-Gov as <em>&ldquo;the mechanism that gives effect to those self-determined ideals [of ID-Sov].&rdquo;</em> Important pockets of work developing these ideals are happening nationally and <a href=https://www.gida-global.org/care target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">internationally</a>. How can collecting institutions meaningfully engage with and practically implement mechanisms for ID-Gov in their work?</p><br><h3 id=transparency-of-roles>Transparency of roles</h3><p>One of the key steps that Robert identified for collecting institutions beginning to implement ID-Gov processes is transparency around different roles within the data ecosystem. Three roles are described by Rose and others (2024) in the article <em><a href=https://doi.org/10.18584/iipj.2023.14.1.10987 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Indigenous Data Governance in Australia: Towards a National Framework</a></em>:</p><ul><li><a href=/resources/glossary/#data-owner title="A person who holds rights, such as copyright or moral rights, over some data." target=_blank>Data owners</a> are those who have legal rights over the materials.</li><li><a href=/resources/glossary/#data-custodian title="A person to whom authority has been given to exercise the rights of a data owner." target=_blank>Data custodians</a> are those who provide storage and access services.</li><li><a href=/resources/glossary/#data-steward title="An individual or organisation with the authority to make decisions regarding the collection." target=_blank>Data stewards</a> are those who process data in different ways.</li></ul><br>Robert commented that:<ul><i>When we talk about the archives, you've got, in many instances, a government who is asserting that it is all three of these things.</i> (RM)</ul><p>When Indigenous data has been collected as &lsquo;archival records&rsquo;, contemporary government departments and agencies acquire a practical authority associated with the role of data owner. The data is also held within their systems and under their care.</p><p>Rose added that:</p><ul><i>The reason it's so important is that it causes a lot of frustration when people don't understand the different roles. If I think about the <a href=https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/archives>Queensland State Archives</a>, they're the custodians of state records, but they're not the owners. The owner remains the state department or agency that created those records.</i> (RB)</ul><p>Being transparent about these roles will improve accountability in institutions and work to address frustration about access to materials in communities.</p><br><body><div><img src=/data-governance-panel/DSC_5637.jpg alt="Robert McLellan speaks on the panel." title=Robert style=width:auto;height:400px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 3: Robert McLellan.</b><br>Image Source: Lewis James Bin Doraho</div></div></body><br><h3 id=auditing-and-metadata-enrichment>Auditing and metadata enrichment</h3><p>Lesley Acres&rsquo;s (Figure 4) work on the <em><a href=https://doi.org/10.14264/ff03c00 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Elevating and Respecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges and perspectives in UQ Special and Research Collections</a></em> project offered an inspiring example of the power of auditing and <a href=/resources/glossary/#metadata title="The information that defines and describes data." target=_blank>metadata</a> enrichment for ID-Gov. Lesley and her team developed an audit methodology to survey materials and enrich their metadata. They refined the methodology using four collections that were identified as high priority:</p><ul><li>Vocabularies of four representative tribes of South Eastern Queensland (F3843)</li><li>Oodgeroo Noonuccal Papers (UQFL84)</li><li>Record of visit to mission stations (Norman Nelson Collection) (UQFL57)</li><li>Caroline Kelly Papers (UQFL489).</li></ul><br>The process uncovered gaps in the library's metadata and was a means of:<ul><i>Giving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people control over their own knowledges... Those four collections had never been audited. Back then, there were three of us — three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women — who were looking at that information, and when we started, the first one we looked at was Caroline Tennant Kelly's papers. By the time we finished auditing that collection, we found over 200 people listed in her <a href=/resources/glossary/#fieldnotes title="Notes taken by a researcher while conducting fieldwork that record their observations and other relevant information." target=_blank>fieldnotes</a>, 47 we recognised as contributors. That collection was so significant in that we met with <a href=https://www.link-upqld.org.au>LinkUp QLD</a>, and they now use that collection to help connect their clients to ancestors.</i> (LA)</ul><br><body><div><img src=/data-governance-panel/DSC_5624.jpg alt="Lesley Acres speaks on the panel." title=Lesley style=width:auto;height:400px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 4: Lesley Acres.</b><br>Image Source: Lewis James Bin Doraho</div></div></body><br><h3 id=getting-out-of-your-comfort-zone>Getting out of your comfort zone</h3><ul><i>What I have said from the beginning is, that you need to get out of your comfort zone, you have to be uncomfortable... You need to look at what your institution stands for, what it's represented and what it's done in the past.</i> (LA)</ul><p>It is important for collecting institutions to investigate their legacy. A core principle of ICIP is <a href=https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/indigenous-cultural-intellectual-property-icip-aitb/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">free, prior and informed consent</a>, which can be difficult to determine for historical collections. In some cases, we might know that permissions were not obtained, or that they were collected, but not in ways that are current best practice. In other cases, we might not have any information about the <a href=/resources/glossary/#provenance title="The documented history or chain of custody of materials from their creation to their current location within a collection." target=_blank>provenance</a> of and permissions surrounding historical materials. Collecting institutions can work to build partnerships, and invest financial and staffing resources, where this is possible, into this reflective and investigative work. Lesley described this type of work as a &ldquo;<em>cultural learning journey</em>.&rdquo;</p><br><h2 id=employing-first-nations-staff>Employing First Nations staff</h2><p>Another key takeaway from Lesley&rsquo;s work at UQ Library is the need for Indigenous staff in collecting institutions. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be employed at all levels to contribute to and lead ID-Gov.</p><ul><i>You need Indigenous staff. You cannot do this without us — because we have the knowledge, we have the understanding, we have the lived experiences.</i> (LA)</ul><p>For Robert, collecting institutions are built around Western governance frameworks, which are not equipped to handle Indigenous knowledge systems. Indigenous communities asking the question, <em>&ldquo;How do I see myself reflected in this piece of digital infrastructure?&rdquo;</em>, need to see representation within institutions. Rose posed an additional prompt for collectives working with data, asking the question, <em>&ldquo;Who is in the room having conversations about Indigenous data?&rdquo;</em></p><p>Lived experience also plays an important role in decision making around technology and digital infrastructure for archival collections.</p><ul><i>Technology is always an amazing opportunity, if it's used in the right way, but you have to have people who have the lived experience of using it the wrong way too.</i> (RB)</ul><br><body><div><img src=/data-governance-panel/DSC_5644-Enhanced-NR.jpg alt="Members of the audience engage with the panellists." title="Audience members" style=width:auto;height:500px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 5: Members of the audience engaging with the panellists.</b><br>Image Source: Lewis James Bin Doraho</div></div></body><br><h2 id=working-with-archives-safely>Working with archives safely</h2><p>The panellists highlighted two important groups impacted by &lsquo;safety&rsquo; in collections work: archival workers themselves and Indigenous communities engaging with collecting institutions.</p><p>All three panellists shared experiences of collectively working through trauma in archival spaces.</p><ul><i>I found my grandfather's records, when I was auditing collections, that I had no knowledge about.</i> (LA)</ul><p>Lesley&rsquo;s team at UQ Library developed a &lsquo;Social and Emotional Wellbeing&rsquo; toolkit to support Indigenous and non-Indigenous library workers. The toolkit gave them space to <em>&ldquo;express, reflect, and digest.&rdquo;</em></p><p>In relation to community safety, the panellists stressed that it is important for communities to decide their own capacity to engage with archival records and collecting institutions.</p><ul><i>It's important to remember that Indigenous Data Governance is Indigenous community members or Indigenous communities deciding for themselves.</i> (RB)</ul><p>When communities are not ready to engage with archival processes, this can be an indicator that now is not the right time to engage with those materials. For communities juggling competing concerns of housing, employment, health or education, collections and library services might be very low priority. As Lesley said, <em>&ldquo;Every consultation process will be different&rdquo;</em> and should go <em>&ldquo;at community&rsquo;s pace.&rdquo;</em></p><hr><blockquote><p><strong><em>We are grateful to all three of the panellists for their theoretical and practical insights into Indigenous Data Governance, as well as to Grant Sarra for facilitating the discussion.</em></strong></p></blockquote><br><p><a name=fn-1>1</a> This summary was prepared by <a href=https://orcid.org/0009-0002-5174-6382 title="Bridey is an Industry Engagement and Communications officer with LDaCA.
