Now, I want to do the same thing, but in relation to a much more complicated case. This project was complicated not by our interdisciplinary team (my colleagues <a href=https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/8379/sam-hames title="Sam is a Research Fellow in the School of Languages and Cultures at The University of Queensland. He is interested in the application of computational methods in humanities research." target=_blank>Sam Hames</a> and <a href=https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/1498/michael-haugh title="Michael is the leader of the LDaCA project and a Professor of Linguistics at The University of Queensland." target=_blank>Michael Haugh</a> were a joy to work with as ever), but by the huge and (currently) unfriendly nature of our data source. The data we worked with came from <a href=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Federal Hansard</a>, the record of the proceedings of the Australian Parliament. Before I start explaining to you the kinds of problems we encountered and how we tried to solve them, let me give you a little background.</p><br><p>Over a year ago, another of our colleagues from The University of Queensland (UQ), <a href=https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/4295/martin-schweinberger title="Martin is a Lecturer in the School of Languages and Cultures at The University of Queensland. He is a quantitative corpus linguist specialized in computational analyses of text and speech." target=_blank>Dr Martin Schweinberger</a>, sent out a call for expressions of interest to contribute to a special issue of the journal <em><a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/lingua target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Lingua</a></em> on the topic of vulgar language. I knew that Sam was already working with Hansard, and in an early conversation with Michael and Sam, I suggested that looking at how vulgar language did or did not appear in parliamentary debate might be an interesting topic. We suggested this to Martin and he was enthusiastic. We realised fairly quickly that vulgar language occurs rarely in Parliament (or at least, it doesn&rsquo;t make it into the formal record — who knows what some of those members are saying to each other off microphone?). More importantly, we also realised that there were interesting questions to examine about how linguistic behaviour is constrained by long-established procedural restrictions.</p><br><p>Our focus moved from vulgar language to the idea of &lsquo;unparliamentary language&rsquo;. In parliaments that draw on the British parliamentary tradition, such as the Australian Federal Parliament, language is ruled by the presiding officer (the Speaker or President) to be unparliamentary when it impugns the character of another member through personal reflections and imputations of improper motives, as well as when language is used about members that might be considered offensive, objectionable or otherwise disorderly. For example, <a href=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Practice_and_Procedure/aso/so203 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Standing Order 203</a> of the Australian Senate deals with Infringement of Order and Section 1c of that Order states that a senator who &ldquo;uses objectionable words, and refuses to withdraw such words&rdquo; will have committed a sanctionable offence. We knew what we were looking for — now we just had to find it in the data&mldr;</p><br><h2 id=the-access-problem>The access problem</h2><br><body><div><img src=/putting-data-to-work-2/hansard.jpeg alt="Several volumes of Hansard" title="Several volumes of Hansard." style=width:auto;height:300px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 1: Several volumes of Hansard.</b><br>Image Source: The Conversation</div></div></body><br><p>&lsquo;Hansard&rsquo; is used as a general term for the published proceedings of Westminster-style parliaments, originating with the records published by a 19th-century London printer called Hansard. The record of the Australian Federal Parliament stretches from the first parliament at federation in 1901 through to the recently commenced 48th parliament. The entire record exists as a physical resource (see Figure 1) and is now also available as a digital resource via the wonderful <a href=https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/search.w3p target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">ParlInfo website</a> — but not in a version that is ideal for our purposes. At ParlInfo, you can search the parliamentary record, filter results in various ways and view relevant proceedings in your browser. The unit in which material is presented is the &lsquo;speech&rsquo;, of which there have been 1.7 million over the life of the Australian parliament. Matters are already a little complicated here — a speech does not necessarily correspond to a single speaker. If a member interjects while another member is speaking, that contribution is included as part of the &lsquo;speech&rsquo;, and for Question Time, a &lsquo;speech&rsquo; consists of the question, the answer and any follow-ups.</p><br><p>Once you have found a section of Hansard which interests you, you can download the material in various ways. You can have a PDF version of the fragment which you are viewing on your screen (that is a single &lsquo;speech&rsquo;), or you can have the proceedings for the whole day (for whichever chamber you are looking at) as a PDF or as an <a href=/resources/glossary/#xml title="Extensible Markup Language" target=_blank>XML</a> file (see Figure 2).</p><br><body><div><img src=/putting-data-to-work-2/hansard-xml.png alt="Sample of Hansard in XML format." title="Sample of Hansard in XML format." style=width:auto;height:px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 2: Sample of Hansard in XML format.</b><br>Image Source: ParlInfo</div></div></body><br><p>The XML <a href=/resources/glossary/#format title="See Data Format." target=_blank>format</a> provides a lot of valuable information, but is also verbose — the example in Figure 1 encodes a speech which consists of only 24 words! ParlInfo does not have functionality to download more than the proceedings of one House on one day at a time. Fortunately, the indefatigable <a href=https://timsherratt.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Tim Sherratt</a> has created an <a href=https://glam-workbench.net/hansard/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">archive</a> of the XML versions, but there are still problems. No XML versions exist for the period 1980 to 1998 (because&mldr; because) and Tim&rsquo;s archive finishes with 2005, after which <a href=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Open Australia</a> is the source for XML.</p><br><p>We wanted to be able to work with the whole record of the Australian Parliament with the actual text easily accessible. Given the intermission in the XML source and because Sam is very clever in these matters, the solution we adopted was to scrape the data from ParlInfo and store it all in a database. The underlying source of the web version contains less information than the XML version, but does provide basic <a href=/resources/glossary/#metadata title="The information that defines and describes data." target=_blank>metadata</a>, such as which parliament the material came from, what date the speeches occurred on and what debate they were part of.<sup><a name=back-1><a href=#fn-1 rel>1</a></a></sup></p><br><h2 id=the-scale-problem>The scale problem</h2><p>There have been around 15,000 sitting days over the life of the Australian Parliament with 1.7 million speeches given. All of those speeches are made up of more than 919 million words, i.e. chunks which are separated by white space or punctuation. So our first problem was: How does one get a grip on so much data?</p><br><p>Using the search capability of a text processor might seem like a good starting point, but in fact, this is not all that helpful. What should we search for exactly? We could have started by searching for words which we already knew might be treated as unparliamentary (for example, calling another member a liar is completely forbidden), but there is no comprehensive list of such words (and as I will discuss later, any such list would change over time). We also considered the possibility of searching for words reflecting the procedural aspects of what interested us, words such as <em>unparliamentary</em> itself. But language is not the only thing that can be referred to as <em>unparliamentary</em>, and we soon realised that this would not work well either.</p><br><h2 id=clustering>Clustering</h2><p>Not all examples of <em>unparliamentary</em> relate immediately to unparliamentary language, but we would expect most instances of unparliamentary language to have the word somewhere in the vicinity. Text analysis has one well-known <a href=/resources/glossary/#tools title="Code or software developed to support or enhance (language) data accessibility and use." target=_blank>tool</a> for looking at words which tend to co-occur, called &lsquo;collocation analysis&rsquo;. The idea is that software can count co-occurrences of words in a window of a certain size around a target word (generally around five words on either side). The probability can be calculated of a pair of words occurring in that window given their rate of occurrence in the whole text sample, and this can be compared with the observed rate of co-occurrence. If a word is co-occurring with the target more often than we would expect from overall frequencies, this can be significant.</p><br><body><div><img src=/putting-data-to-work-2/hansard-collocates.png alt="The top 30 collocates of 'unparliamentary' in the proceedings of the House of Representatives, 37th Parliament." title="The top 30 collocates of 'unparliamentary' in the proceedings of the House of Representatives, 37th Parliament." style=width:auto;height:600px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 3: The top 30 collocates of 'unparliamentary' in the proceedings of the House of Representatives, 37th Parliament.</b><br>Image Source: Public Domain</div></div></body><br><p>Collocation analysis gave us some insights into two kinds of other words which occurred in proximity to the word <em>unparliamentary</em>. One group was associated with the procedural aspects of unparliamentary language; in Figure 3, you can see examples of these words, such as <em>withdraw(n)</em>, and of words referring to the presiding officers, such as <em>speaker</em> and <em>deputy</em>. The second group of words relate to the content of language which might be unparliamentary. Examples of such words in Figure 3 are <em>hypocrite</em> and <em>liar</em>.</p><br><p>We also applied a more complex <a href=/resources/glossary/#methods title="Procedures, processes or techniques which can be systematically and repetitively used to achieve a particular goal." target=_blank>method</a> for examining clusters of words, a method for which Sam has been developing a tool. This method starts by clustering words algorithmically according to patterns of co-occurrence across some unit of analysis, in this case, the speech (as discussed above, this is the unit into which proceedings are divided). The initial clusters can then be sorted according to how similar they are to the words which occur in speeches which include the word <em>unparliamentary</em>. We selected the 50 clusters most similar to the unparliamentary speeches and then focused on the 20 most similar words in each of those clusters. This analysis confirmed and extended the collocation analysis, and we identified six broad conceptual clusters in the data:</p><ul><li>procedural</li><li>type of unparliamentary language</li><li>uptake of unparliamentary language</li><li>contesting unparliamentary language</li><li>mediatisation of unparliamentary language</li><li>characterising unparliamentary language.</li></ul><br><p>It was at this point that we were confident that our focus on the context, rather than the content, was leading to interesting results. Our computational methods had allowed us to get to grips with the huge amount of data and those methods were providing fascinating insights into what the people involved understood about their procedures and how they acted within those constraints.</p><br><h2 id=close-reading>Close reading</h2><p>The methods described in the previous section gave us a rich picture of the landscape in which unparliamentary language happens, but it was still a high-level picture. We were keen also to try to understand what happened at the level of individual interactions. In order to do this, we chose one theme within the broad &lsquo;Type of unparliamentary language&rsquo; category mentioned above, a cluster of words associated with racism and bigotry. We chose to look at this topic, because we hypothesised that it would be one which had changed across the time period represented in the data, in contrast to a topic such as &rsquo;lying&rsquo;, which would be a steady presence. This turned out to be a correct hypothesis — the words <em>racist(s)</em> and <em>racism</em> do not appear in Hansard until 1956, which means that we were able to trace how these words came to be treated as unparliamentary.</p><br><p>Of course, we still had a problem in finding the data which was relevant for our purposes; just searching for the crucial words would return large lists of hits, many of which would not be relevant. For example, the word <em>racist</em> returns more than 3,600 hits in the parliamentary record at ParlInfo. The approach we used was to write a simple script which searched for occurrences of the words <em>racist(s)/racism</em> and then checked whether <em>(un)parliamentary</em> appeared in either the preceding or following 200 characters. Running the script across the whole data set gave us 132 candidate instances which might be relevant for research. Not all of them were, but establishing that was a lot easier than checking several thousand possibilities!</p><br><p>What we found, in summary, is that the new content which could be regarded as unparliamentary quickly became part of the procedural landscape: presiding officers rapidly moved to (almost complete) consensus that calling someone a racist was offensive and, therefore, unparliamentary, and members of Parliament equally rapidly adopted the same kind of rhetorical manoeuvres which have always been used to sneak in attacks on other parliamentarians. In the case of racism, this has the bizarre result that a member can be required to withdraw remarks on the basis that they express a racist attitude and are therefore unparliamentary, but another member cannot then say that the first member is a racist — that is also unparliamentary!</p><br><h2 id=concluding-remarks>Concluding remarks</h2><p>I will start here by quoting a passage from the methodology section in our <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384125000579 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">published paper</a> (references omitted):</p><blockquote><p>We approached the analysis of this dataset through an iterative computational-interpretive approach … involv[ing] the dialogic use of &lsquo;distant&rsquo; computational methods, such as (un)supervised machine learning and algorithms, alongside &lsquo;close&rsquo; interpretive analysis of individual cases to analyse sociopragmatic phenomena. In a dialogic approach to analysis it is presumed that one cannot make sense of phenomena that occur across large datasets without both closely engaging with close reading of contextualised instances of the phenomenon in question and the broader patterns that can only be identified through computational means.</p></blockquote><p>I hope that what I have described above gives you, the reader, a sense of what this approach means in practice.</p><br><p>A central problem in this dialogic approach, especially when working with such a huge dataset, is identifying which examples are appropriate for close analysis. In the previous related post, I discussed finding evidence to support a position — there, the issues were mainly about building an evidence base large enough to generate confidence in observations, but the nature of the observations (whether a word occurs or not) were straightforward. The research described here had different problems — having enough data was not an issue, but the nature of the observations which would support an argument (how participants behaved in an interaction and how they understood it) were much more complex and required very specific pieces of evidence to be retrieved from the data. We believe that we found the data which supported our arguments and I have tried here to illuminate that process for you.</p><hr><h3 id=footnote>Footnote</h3><p><a name=fn-1>1</a> A plan to improve access to Hansard and other public interest documents is currently being developed as part of the <a href=https://ardc.edu.au/project/ardc-community-data-lab/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">ARDC Community Data Lab</a>.
