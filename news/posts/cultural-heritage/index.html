She also manages the ANU PARADISEC unit and offers training in archiving, digital preservation and data management. Julia received a PhD in Linguistics from the University of Washington.">Dr Julia Colleen Miller</b></p><br><p>For nearly ten years, I have been officially working as a Data Manager. I say <em>officially</em> because having worked on collaborative research projects and earning a PhD in Linguistics, within the context of an endangered language documentation collaborative project, I&rsquo;ve been managing other people&rsquo;s data, as well as my own, since I was a fledgling academic in the early 2000s.</p><br><p>I am based at the Australian National University (ANU), and since mid-2023, I&rsquo;ve been working as the senior data manager for the Language Data Commons of Australia (<a href=https://www.ldaca.edu.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">LDaCA</a>). Prior to this, I worked for the <a href=/resources/glossary/#arc title="Australian Research Council" target=_blank>ARC</a> Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (<a href=https://legacy.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">CoEDL</a>), who could offer a eight year data manager position, very generous in a field where contracts often last only two or three years. It was at CoEDL where I first took on this academic-adjacent role, focusing on bolstering research and <a href=/resources/glossary/#research-infrastructure title="The resources and services that are needed for research communities to conduct research." target=_blank>research infrastructure</a>. It was also the first time I had heard of such a position becoming available that addressed the data management and archiving needs of those actively recording or assembling cultural heritage data. Such data includes tabular data, text <a href=/resources/glossary/#corpus title="A collection of real-life examples of language selected to be a fair representation of the language or a particular linguistic genre." target=_blank>corpora</a>, collections of songs and music, ethnographic interviews, elicited linguistic content, oral histories, traditional narratives and lexicons, and can be in different formats, such as text, video, audio, image, film, magnetic tape and digital files.</p><br><p>The best part of this CoEDL role was that the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (<a href=https://www.paradisec.org.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">PARADISEC</a>), where I had been running the ANU unit since 2010, was going to be the main repository for CoEDL, and the two roles of archivist and data manager would be fundamentally intertwined. I had finally found my calling!</p><br><h2 id=the-day-to-day-of-data-management-and-archiving>The day-to-day of data management and archiving</h2><p>At CoEDL, my primary responsibility was to help facilitate the data management and subsequent archiving of materials collected by CoEDL members and affiliates from institutions such as ANU, The University of Queensland, The University of Melbourne, Western Sydney University (WSU), as well as by the broader global research communities. This involved managing a continuous flow of enquiries from new and continuing researchers, offering guidance, and overseeing the entire data management and archiving processes. My aim was to ensure that valuable research data was preserved and made:</p><ul><li>accessible for future research</li><li>available to the people and communities recorded, as well as to their descendants.</li></ul><br><p>Most days, in-person or over Zoom, I met with depositors to:</p><ul><li>guide them through the process of describing their data for their own research databases, making eventual archiving much easier</li><li>discuss appropriate file formats</li><li>find or create collaborative workspaces for CoEDL students, staff and their external collaborators</li><li>develop data access protocols, refining conditions of access for archived collections</li><li>offer file transfer options, ensuring secure data transmission</li><li>inform researchers of other archiving alternatives if <a href=/resources/glossary/#paradisec title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target=_blank>PARADISEC</a> was not the best fit for their material.</li></ul><br><p>Over the years, I have tried to make the data management and archiving processes more efficient and helpful by creating archiving guides. Originally, these were static PDF files available on the CoEDL website; however, as they needed to be dynamic sources of information for rapidly changing technologies, they are now a <a href=https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">series of webpages</a>.</p><br><body><div><img src=/cultural-heritage/fig_1_overview_page.png alt="PARADISEC's Archiving Guides and Technical Workflows Overview Page" title="PARADISEC's Archiving Guides and Technical Workflows Overview Page" style=width:auto;height:600px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 1: Screenshot of the overview page of PARADISEC's Archiving Guides and Technical Workflows website.</b><br>Image Source: Dr Julia Colleen Miller</div></div></body><br><h2 id=managing-the-paradisec-anu-unit>Managing the PARADISEC ANU unit</h2><p>In my concurrent role as manager of the ANU unit of <a href=/resources/glossary/#paradisec title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target=_blank>PARADISEC</a>, I oversaw a wide range of digitisation and archiving activities, ensuring that important cultural materials were preserved and accessible for current and future use.</p><br><h3 id=digitising-analogue-materials>Digitising analogue materials</h3><p>We often receive magnetic tape audio (cassette and reel-to-reel tapes) and <a href=/resources/glossary/#field-notebook-journal title="A collection of fieldnotes compiled while completing fieldwork." target=_blank>field notebooks</a> to archive. Engaging with <a href=/resources/glossary/#legacy-format title="An old, outdated or obsolete file format that is no longer supported by modern hardware and/or software systems." target=_blank>legacy formats</a> is equal parts exciting and challenging. The challenging parts are:</p><ul><li>finding and maintaining the necessary playback devices</li><li>dealing with damaged or mouldy materials</li><li>creating functional, evolving workflows</li><li>adhering to standards set by digital preservation&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.dpconline.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">peak bodies</a>.</li></ul><br><p>&mldr;but the rewards are legion. There is nothing like hearing voices recorded decades ago, and then sharing those recordings with descendants of those speakers! It&rsquo;s also a great feeling to make available rare language material by digitising the items, and then engage with young researchers to help enrich the descriptions of the content. Even more so if it helps them with their research topics.</p><br><p>Some of the digitising tasks we conducted during this time for CoEDL researchers and general <a href=/resources/glossary/#paradisec title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target=_blank>PARADISEC</a> depositors were:</p><ul><li>digitising audio cassettes and reel-to-reel tapes, performing all necessary post-production editing to prepare for archiving</li></ul><br><body><div><img src=/cultural-heritage/fig_2_studer_player.png alt="Studer Reel-to-Reel Tape Player" title="Studer Reel-to-Reel Tape Player" style=width:auto;height:400px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 2: Studer reel-to-reel tape player, with a tape threaded and ready to digitise.</b><br>Image Source: Dr Julia Colleen Miller</div></div></body><br><ul><li>photographing tapes and tape boxes containing written <a href=/resources/glossary/#metadata title="The information that defines and describes data." target=_blank>metadata</a> on their labels or inserts found within; these images then accompanied the audio files in the archive</li></ul><br><body><div><img src=/cultural-heritage/fig_3_tapes_boxes.png alt="Tapes, Tape Boxes and Sheets of Paper" title="Tapes, Tape Boxes and Sheets of Paper" style=width:auto;height:px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 3: Collection of images of reel-to-reel tapes, tape boxes and loose sheets of paper, all containing important written metadata about the contents of the tapes.</b><br>Image Source: Haoyi Li</div></div></body><br><ul><li>digitising manuscripts and <a href=/resources/glossary/#field-notebook-journal title="A collection of fieldnotes compiled while completing fieldwork." target=_blank>field journals</a>, ensuring high-quality reproduction.</li></ul><br><body><div><img src=/cultural-heritage/fig_4_digitising_notebook.png alt="Digitisation of Field Notebook" title="Digitisation of Field Notebook" style=width:auto;height:500px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 4: Digitising a field notebook with a DSLR camera mounted to an overhead shelf (out of shot).

With this easy access to quality recorders for use in the field, people have the freedom to collect as much data as needed to address their research questions. We receive hundreds (sometimes thousands) of digital files each week to help manage, and eventually, archive.</p><br><p>Some activities involved in managing born-digital files are:</p><ul><li>receiving files and creating detailed inventories of them — a critical step in ensuring all files are looked after and that quality checking can be logged</li><li>resampling audio, <a href=/resources/glossary/#transcoding title="The process of converting one digital encoding format to another." target=_blank>transcoding</a> image and video files to archival formats and managing the transfer to <a href=/resources/glossary/#paradisec title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target=_blank>PARADISEC</a> for archiving</li><li>devising solutions for problematic video formats and liaising with commercial service providers and other institutions for help when needed.</li></ul><br><p>Below is an image of an inventory spreadsheet containing the structural <a href=/resources/glossary/#metadata title="The information that defines and describes data." target=_blank>metadata</a> of thousands of files that went into a single collection: Lauren Reed&rsquo;s <a href=https://dx.doi.org/10.26278/6S03-BA52 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Western Highlands Sign Languages</a>.</p><br><body><div><img src=/cultural-heritage/fig_5_metadata_spreadsheet.png alt="Metadata Spreadsheet for LRW1 Collection in PARADISEC" title="Metadata Spreadsheet for LRW1 Collection in PARADISEC" style=width:auto;height:500px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 5: Screenshot of spreadsheet of structural metadata of audio and video files from the LRW1 collection in PARADISEC.

Also, I could compare details of the output files to the originals, thus helping with quality checks. As I worked through the files, I could keep track of my progress by marking which ones had been transcoded and were ready to send to the archive. This task took months to complete, so it was important to be able to pick up each day right where I had left off on the previous day.</p><br><blockquote><p>If you are interested in learning how to batch extract this type of metadata from media files, visit the page <em><a href=https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/10_quality_control.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Quality control of audio and video files</a></em> from PARADISEC&rsquo;s archiving guides and technical workflows.</p></blockquote><br><p>Over the life of CoEDL, we monitored the annual growth of files added to PARADISEC. The following graphic shows the period from 2008 to 2022. <em>Note: CoEDL was active between November 2014 and December 2022.</em></p><br><body><div><img src=/cultural-heritage/fig_6_graph_files.png alt="Graph of File Numbers in PARADISEC from 2008 to 2022" title="Graph of File Numbers in PARADISEC from 2008 to 2022" style=width:auto;height:400px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 6: Line graph showing the growth of the number of files held in the PARADISEC archive between the years 2008 and 2022.</b><br>Image Source: Dr Julia Colleen Miller</div></div></body><br><p>Notice the increase in files starting in 2015. It was at this time I received research assistant (RA) support from CoEDL to help manage the influx of data. Over the years, I supervised several RAs and volunteers, managing their day-to-day tasks and overseeing their professional growth.</p><br><p>By 2020, after refinements in our server connections and file transfer pipelines, we were sending a minimum of 500GB of audio-visual files to the archive every other day! I could never have achieved this without the support of the CoEDL RAs, Team Data: Jen Plaistowe, Tina Gregor, Melody Ross, Haoyi Li, Shubo Li, and our volunteer, Emma Cuppit.</p><br><h2 id=collaboration-with-cultural-institutions-in-the-region>Collaboration with cultural institutions in the region</h2><p>Collaborating with other cultural institutions was a significant aspect of my roles at CoEDL and <a href=/resources/glossary/#paradisec title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target=_blank>PARADISEC</a>, allowing us to increase access to archived materials, enhance our archiving capabilities and share expertise. Below are two examples of collaborative projects.</p><br><h3 id=anu-pacific-research-archives>ANU Pacific Research Archives</h3><p>Occasionally, requests would come from ANU&rsquo;s <a href=https://archives.anu.edu.au/collections/pacific-research-archives target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Pacific Research Archives</a> staff, or directly from students and researchers, to digitise items collected across the Pacific which were housed in ANU&rsquo;s archives. We targeted audio tapes and field notes for digitisation, enhancing ANU&rsquo;s finding guides with detailed <a href=/resources/glossary/#metadata title="The information that defines and describes data." target=_blank>metadata</a>. Typically, we archived these digital files in <a href=/resources/glossary/#paradisec title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target=_blank>PARADISEC</a> and shared links to new collections, or provided copies back to the Pacific Research Archives.</p><br><p>A notable project involved digitising select items from the <a href=https://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/papers-20 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Helen Groger-Wurm collection</a> at ANU. Helen Groger-Wurm, an anthropologist active in the 1960s, focused on Northern Australia, particularly Eastern Arnhem Land bark paintings.</p><br><p>PARADISEC and CoEDL secured funding to digitise 26 audio tapes from this collection. This effort supported CoEDL PhD student Haoyi Li, who, due to COVID-19 restrictions, couldn&rsquo;t conduct <a href=/resources/glossary/#fieldwork title="The collection of data from an environment where the data is likely to occur naturally or organically without the intervention of researchers." target=_blank>fieldwork</a> in Arnhem Land when she was hoping to. Haoyi identified relevant items for her research, and we expanded the digitisation to include field notes alongside the audio tapes. This initiative enabled her to start her primary research remotely and gain valuable skills in archival engagement with legacy recordings, high-resolution image capture of field notes, open reel audio tape digitisation, metadata collection and archival record enrichment.</p><br><body><div><img src=/cultural-heritage/fig_7_tape_threading.png alt="Threading of Helen Groger-Wurm Tape for Digitisation " title="Threading of Helen Groger-Wurm Tape for Digitisation" style=width:auto;height:400px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 7: Haoyi Li threading a Helen Groger-Wurm reel-to-reel tape for digitisation on the Revox C 270 tape player.</b><br>Image Source: Dr Julia Colleen Miller</div></div></body><br><p>The images below are from a tape digitised by Haoyi Li from the Helen Groger-Wurm collection in the Pacific Research Archives at ANU.

For example, we identified items produced by the important 20th century Australian linguist <a href=https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/capell-arthur-12292 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Arthur Capell</a>, including 168 reel-to-reel audio tapes of non-Australian language recordings found in the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (<a href=https://aiatsis.gov.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">AIATSIS</a>) that we were able to digitise, and nearly 50 acetate discs and one magnetic wire recording found at the National Library of Australia (<a href=https://www.nla.gov.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">NLA</a>).

I have participated in conferences and workshops, representing CoEDL and <a href=/resources/glossary/#paradisec title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target=_blank>PARADISEC</a> while discussing best practices in archiving and data management. I also focused on developing training sessions aimed at enhancing digitisation techniques, <a href=/resources/glossary/#metadata title="The information that defines and describes data." target=_blank>metadata</a> management and workflow optimisation for fellow archivists.</p><br><p>As a member of the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (<a href=https://www.iasa-web.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">IASA</a>), I continue to contribute to their Technical Committee, where I can participate in discussions that influence the development of digital preservation standards. I also contribute to the creation of guidelines for born-digital video, aiming to ensure they are relevant to current technological advancements and archival needs.</p><br><p>I have collaborated with Charles Sturt University&rsquo;s <a href=https://study.csu.edu.au/courses/master-information-studies target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Master of Information Studies program</a>, guiding a student through an approved curriculum I developed that aimed to bridge academic learning with practical skills. These teaching materials have been used again for students from the University of Manchester&rsquo;s Master of Arts programs in Digital Media, Culture and Society, and in Library and Archive Studies under the tutelage of my PARADISEC colleague, Nick Ward.</p><br><p>During ANU&rsquo;s COVID-19 lockdown, I designed a 10-week online training module to accommodate my newly hired RAs, providing foundational knowledge in digitisation and archiving techniques. This online training was extended to ANU&rsquo;s Summer Scholar interns, who were also missing out on activities due to lockdown. We focused on audio and manuscript digitisation practices, as well as introducing them to the history of digital language archives. When the lockdown was lifted, we followed up with hands-on training. One of the interns, a PhB student in Linguistics, Daniel Majchrzak (seen in the image below), has been trained in high-resolution image capture of manuscripts and <a href=/resources/glossary/#fieldnotes title="Notes taken by a researcher while conducting fieldwork that record their observations and other relevant information." target=_blank>fieldnotes</a> and is now working in our studio to digitise the papers of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luise_Hercus target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Luise Hercus</a>.</p><br><body><div><img src=/cultural-heritage/fig_14_hercus_manuscripts.png alt="Image Capture of Luise Hercus Manuscripts" title="Image Capture of Luise Hercus Manuscripts" style=width:auto;height:500px class=center_image><div style=text-align:center><b>Figure 14: PhB student, Daniel Majchrzak, using a shelf-mounted digital camera for high-resolution image capture of the manuscripts of Luise Hercus.</b><br>Image Source: Dr Julia Colleen Miller</div></div></body><br><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final thoughts</h2><p>Data management is an integral element of institutional <a href=/resources/glossary/#research-infrastructure title="The resources and services that are needed for research communities to conduct research." target=_blank>research infrastructure</a>. It often falls within that fluid space between the roles of academic and professional staff — within what is called the Third Space in academia (to read more on this topic, take a look at <em>"<a href=https://www.routledge.com/Reconstructing-Identities-in-Higher-Education-The-rise-of-Third-Space/Whitchurch/p/book/9780415614832 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Reconstructing Identities in Higher Education: The rise of &lsquo;Third Space&rsquo; professionals</a>"</em>, by Celia Whitchurch, 2013). Many of the activities carried out as Data Manager for CoEDL, and now for <a href=/resources/glossary/#ldaca title="Language Data Commons of Australia" target=_blank>LDaCA</a>, were designed to assist in educational development and knowledge exchange, as well as to promote public engagement and outreach.
