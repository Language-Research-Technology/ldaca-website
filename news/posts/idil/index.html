Making language resources and materials sustainable and accessible is central to the work of <a href=/resources/glossary/#ldaca title="Language Data Commons of Australia" target=_blank>LDaCA</a>. This includes working in collaboration with communities, and providing them with the <a href=/resources/glossary/#tools title="Code or software developed to support or enhance (language) data accessibility and use." target=_blank>tools</a> and support they need to be effective custodians of their language materials.</p><p>The sub-theme has six components (<em>Voices of Country</em> p34):</p><ol><li>Embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural practices and knowledge systems into linguistic methodologies.</li><li>Develop resources that document and record languages, such as dictionaries, encyclopaedias, thesauri, grammar and orthography documents.</li><li>Record and digitise written and oral language <a href=/resources/glossary/#collection title="A group of related Objects." target=_blank>collections</a>, resources and materials.</li><li>Provide communities with the support, training and infrastructure they require to build language resources and collections.</li><li>Support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to access and repurpose historical language materials.</li><li>Repatriate language materials and cultural knowledge to community ownership and control.</li></ol><p>We will give a brief summary of how LDaCA is contributing to each of these areas of activity, first covering components two to six and then returning to show how all of those activities contribute to the first component. In this summary, we will refer occasionally to the <a href=/about/principles/ rel>FAIR and CARE</a> ethical research principles which are core to our work. The <a href=/resources/glossary/#fair title="Four key principles developed in 2016 with the aim of supporting the discovery and reuse of research data." target=_blank>FAIR</a> principles have been developed as a foundation for good, scholarly ways of finding and using data, providing key guideposts (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for transparent, reproducible, and reusable language research. Further key principles for advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination, <a href=/resources/glossary/#care title="Four key principles developed for respectful handling of Indigenous data." target=_blank>CARE</a> (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics), guide ethical work with Indigenous language collections. The concluding discussion will also detail the connection between the principles, especially the CARE principles, and LDaCA’s work supporting the <em>Voices of Country</em> Action Plan.</p><br><h3 id=component-2-develop-resources-that-document-and-record-languages>Component 2: Develop resources that document and record languages</h3><p>LDaCA contributes to work under component two by providing recommendations for good practice in developing sustainable resources. It is important to avoid having data locked into bespoke individual solutions which may be difficult to maintain. Instead, we advocate using data formats that can be supported into the future and which can be the basis for various <a href=/resources/glossary/#tools title="Code or software developed to support or enhance (language) data accessibility and use." target=_blank>tools</a>. Although LDaCA can have only a limited role in developing resources, such as dictionaries or text <a href=/resources/glossary/#collection title="A group of related Objects." target=_blank>collections</a>, we can provide advice about key aspects of data handling, assist with designing backup strategies, and work with people to develop long-term strategies for appropriate access to language resources.</p><br><h3 id=component-3-record-and-digitise-written-and-oral-language-materials>Component 3: Record and digitise written and oral language materials</h3><p>Similarly to component two, we have an indirect role in activity related to component three. We support recording and digitisation through our collaborative partnerships with the <a href=/resources/glossary/#nyingarn title="A 3-year Australian Research Council funded project that will provide digital access to early sources of Australia's Indigenous languages." target=_blank>Nyingarn</a> project and with <a href=/resources/glossary/#paradisec title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target=_blank>PARADISEC</a>. Nyingarn is a platform for making manuscript and typescript sources for Indigenous languages available as searchable digital objects, while PARADISEC has extensive experience in digitising language materials. Increasingly, LDaCA and these partners share a single technological ecosystem, leading to greater alignment in formats and description for digital versions of historical materials, which, in turn, increases the sustainability and usability of the materials.</p><br><h3 id=component-4-provide-communities-with-support-training-and-infrastructure-to-build-language-resources>Component 4: Provide communities with support, training and infrastructure to build language resources</h3><p>Contributing to component four, LDaCA is working with various Indigenous groups and organisations to help manage the language resources and <a href=/resources/glossary/#collection title="A group of related Objects." target=_blank>collections</a> they hold. An example is our partnership with the <a href=https://www.batchelor.edu.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education</a>, which holds an important archive of physical and digital works in, and about, Indigenous languages. The collection is managed by the Batchelor Institute Library and has strong connections with language projects through the Institute’s Centre for Australian Languages and Linguistics (CALL).</p><p>The <a href=https://callcollection.batchelor.edu.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">CALL Collection</a> includes text, audio and video resources that have been contributed over at least 30 years by students and staff of the Batchelor Institute, as well as by teachers, linguists and language workers external to the institute. We are working with the Batchelor Institute to:</p><ul><li>backup and reformat item record information</li><li>copy <a href=/resources/glossary/#metadata title="The information that defines and describes data." target=_blank>metadata</a> from an ageing database into contemporary metadata standard format</li><li>embed cultural protocols to ensure long-term and appropriate access to this significant collection.</li></ul><p>We are also working on training programs, designed with First Nations people, which will help make resources accessible to non-academic users of language data.</p><br><h3 id=component-5-support-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples-to-access-and-repurpose-historical-language-materials>Component 5: Support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to access and repurpose historical language materials</h3><p>Component five aligns closely with the A and the R in the <a href=/resources/glossary/#fair title="Four key principles developed in 2016 with the aim of supporting the discovery and reuse of research data." target=_blank>FAIR</a> principles: <strong>Accessibility</strong> and <strong>Reusability</strong>. In order for data to meet these FAIR criteria, it must be well-described, but in many cases, existing <a href=/resources/glossary/#collection title="A group of related Objects." target=_blank>collections</a> of Indigenous data are not as well-described as they might be, and even when they are considered to be well-described, the description is often based on non-Indigenous knowledge.</p><p>LDaCA is contributing to component five of the sub-theme by developing methods to make it easier to enrich existing descriptions of data, with the aim of moving towards Indigenous knowledges as the basis for the description of Indigenous data. We have carried out a pilot project with The University of Queensland libraries, in which records from the library system have been enriched with additional annotations based on Indigenous knowledges of the collection items. The results of this project can be seen in a dedicated <a href=https://ild.ldaca.edu.au/search target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">data portal</a>.</p><br><h3 id=component-6-repatriate-language-materials-and-cultural-knowledge-to-community-ownership-and-control>Component 6: Repatriate language materials and cultural knowledge to community ownership and control</h3><p>The A in the <a href=/resources/glossary/#care title="Four key principles developed for respectful handling of Indigenous data." target=_blank>CARE</a> principles stands for <strong>Authority to control</strong>. LDaCA’s approach to sustainable data includes a commitment to storing explicit licences with data, detailing in plain text who can access data and what the data can be used for. In line with component six, the communities and people who are the source of Indigenous data have the authority to make decisions about such matters: they decide who can access data and what users can do with the data.</p><p>LDaCA has developed policies and technical solutions for implementing such access controls that make ongoing administration of access as straightforward as possible. We are sharing ideas and solutions with our colleagues in the Indigenous stream of the <a href=https://ardc.edu.au/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons</a>. The solutions that we are using for Indigenous data can also apply to other human-sourced data. As <a href=https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/centres-institutes/onemda/research-group/indigenous-studies-unit/about-us/our-team/levi-craig-murray target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Levi-Craig Murray</a> is fond of saying: “What&rsquo;s good for mob, is good for everyone”.</p><br><h3 id=component-1-embed-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-cultural-practices-and-knowledge-systems-into-linguistic-methodologies>Component 1: Embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural practices and knowledge systems into linguistic methodologies</h3><p>As stated above, we see all of the activities from components two to six as contributing to the aim of embedding Indigenous knowledges and cultural practices into our methodologies. When working with language material, LDaCA is guided by <a href=/resources/glossary/#fair title="Four key principles developed in 2016 with the aim of supporting the discovery and reuse of research data." target=_blank>FAIR</a> and <a href=/resources/glossary/#care title="Four key principles developed for respectful handling of Indigenous data." target=_blank>CARE</a> principles (Carroll et al. 2020; Carroll et al. 2021; Wilkinson et al. 2016). The FAIR principles provide guidance on ensuring that data will be useful in the future, though they do this from a Western scientific perspective. The CARE principles extend the FAIR data management principles and we hope that our commitment to these principles assists us in contributing to the goals of the <em>Voices of Country</em> plan:</p><ul><li>Making data more sustainable and more informed by Indigenous knowledges helps ensure that Indigenous communities benefit from the data.</li><li>Providing accessible solutions for access management contributes to First Nations people’s authority to control Indigenous data.</li><li>Supporting Indigenous communities in developing data capabilities helps to build positive relationships and show responsibility in our work with Indigenous Peoples.</li><li>Basing all of our work on ethical principles respects the rights and well-being of Indigenous Peoples.</li></ul><p>We see all of our activities as both being guided by the CARE principles, and as contributing to the overall aim of embedding Indigenous knowledges and cultural practices into our methodologies. Indigenous control of access to data, Indigenous perspectives made part of the description of data, and using Indigenous perspectives to make data more accessible to communities are all part of this endeavour.</p><br><h2 id=further-reading-and-references>Further reading and references</h2><p>2022 - 2032 International Decade of Indigenous Languages. <em>2022 - 2032 International Decade of Indigenous Languages</em>. <a href=https://idil2022-2032.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">https://idil2022-2032.org/</a>.
