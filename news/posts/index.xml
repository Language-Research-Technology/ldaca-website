Important aims and motivations of the LDaCA project are to secure language data in Australia and to make it easily available to researchers (and other interested parties). But language researchers have been aware of these issues for some time and the AusNC was an earlier attempt to address them.</description></item><item><title>Graduate Digital Research Fellowship</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/gdrf/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 09:00:00 +1000</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/gdrf/</guid><description>In 2018, when he was working at The University of Queensland&amp;rsquo;s (UQ) Research Computing Centre (RCC), Marco Fahmi (former LDaCA Project Manager) initiated a Graduate Digital Research Fellowship (GDRF) program focused on researchers in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS). The program has run in some years since then, hosted by the RCC (2019) and also by the UQ Graduate School (2020).
In 2023, the program ran again, this time under the auspices of the Australian Text Analytics Program (ATAP).</description></item><item><title>Interview with our Chief Investigators - Part 2</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/interview-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 07:51:43 +1100</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/interview-2/</guid><description>The Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) and the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) are collaborative projects led by the University of Queensland and supported by the Australian Research Data Commons to develop infrastructure for researchers who work with language data.

This presentation was delivered by Peter Sefton at the Open Repositories 2023 conference in South Africa on 2023-06-14 in the Presentations: Discipline specific systems with FAIR principles session.
This contains the slides and complete speaker notes, which have been edited after the conference.
We will present a standards-based generalized architecture for large-scale data* repositories for research and preservation illustrated with real-world examples drawn from a number of languages and cultural archive projects.</description></item><item><title>Interview with our Chief Investigators - Part 1</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/interview-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 15:28:35 +1000</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/interview-1/</guid><description>The Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) and the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) are collaborative projects led by the University of Queensland and supported by the Australian Research Data Commons to develop infrastructure for researchers who work with language data.

But what does this include? We are aware of many data sources and, in the short term, the important questions are about priorities:
What will be immediately useful? What data is stored precariously? What relationships can be leveraged? But in thinking for the long term, there is value in asking the question from a more conceptual point of view:</description></item><item><title>Designing a metadata ecosystem for language research based on Research Object Crate (RO-Crate)</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/ldaca-metadata-ecosystem-eresearch-2022/</guid><description>PDF version

But the rest of the world are bringing with them new approaches to how data is handled. This means that fields such as corpus linguistics may need to reassess their practices. Such reassessment includes addressing concerns about how data is stored and who can access it (data stewardship) – concerns that are a part of the Open Science movement, ultimately grounded on principles of equity and accountability.</description></item></channel></rss>
