&lt;p>Many corpus linguists analyse language in the media, especially in newspaper corpora. These corpora often contain hundreds, if not thousands, of published articles from newspapers, which are protected by copyright and typically cannot easily be shared with others outside the research team. At the same time, the sharing of data is encouraged or might even be required by funding bodies, journals and other research stakeholders, as this enables reproducibility and has other positive effects on scientific research. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.go-fair.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">FAIR principles&lt;/a>, data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable — as further discussed by Simon Musgrave in &lt;a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/fair-and-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">this blog post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Corpus spotlight: Mitchell and Delbridge</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/mitchell-delbridge/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/mitchell-delbridge/</guid><description>&lt;p>by &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0002-5174-6382" title="Bridey is an Industry Engagement and Communications officer with LDaCA.

&lt;p>Nick Thieberger (Figure 1) is an Associate Professor in the &lt;a href="https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/school-of-languages-and-linguistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">School of Languages and Linguistics&lt;/a> at The University of Melbourne (&lt;a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">UniMelb&lt;/a>). After an undergraduate degree in linguistics, Nick worked with various Indigenous groups, before creating a handbook of languages in Western Australia and then helping to set up the &lt;a href="https://www.wangkamaya.org.au/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Wangka Maya Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre&lt;/a> in Port Hedland. That experience, together with an interest in harnessing new technologies, took Nick to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (&lt;a href="https://aiatsis.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">AIATSIS&lt;/a>) in Canberra, before a period of living in Vanuatu, where he also collected data on the Nafsan (South Efate) language, the topic of his doctoral dissertation. Documenting the Nafsan language reinforced Nick&amp;rsquo;s commitment to making enduring and high-quality records of cultural and linguistic material, and when he returned to Australia, he was part of the group which founded the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (&lt;a href="https://www.paradisec.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">PARADISEC&lt;/a>), of which he is now Director. During a period at the &lt;a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">University of Hawai&amp;rsquo;i&lt;/a>, Nick set up the &lt;a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/communities/533eb99e-2e59-47a5-9c4e-652352bfc5a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Kaipuleohone&lt;/a> digital archive.

&lt;p>When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/glossary/#metadata" title="The information that defines and describes data." target="_blank"

 >collection&lt;/a
>, it is best to use the same terms for the same data, rather than changing how you describe data over time. It also means that, if possible, it is better to use an existing metadata &lt;a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/glossary/#schema" title="Specifies a metadata vocabulary of Classes and Properties, based on the RO-Crate specification&amp;#39;s use of Schema.org classes." target="_blank"

If you are using terms from a range of different metadata schemas, it is always best to identify which metadata schema the term comes from.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflecting on the Darwin digital languages collections workshop</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/darwin-digital-collections-workshop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/news/posts/darwin-digital-collections-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>by &lt;a href="https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/10861/chenoa-pettrup" title="Chenoa Pettrup is the Industry Engagement and Communications Lead for the Language Data Commons of Australia." target="_blank"
