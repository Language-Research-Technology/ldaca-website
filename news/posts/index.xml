&lt;li>What will be immediately useful?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What data is stored precariously?&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="fair-and-care">FAIR and CARE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Data is becoming increasingly important in today’s world, so &lt;a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/glossary/#corpus" title="A collection of real-life examples of language selected to be a fair representation of the language or a particular linguistic genre." target="_blank"
