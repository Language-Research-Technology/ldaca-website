Tools are designed to work in low-resource environments, allowing communities to have agency and control over their materials. We prioritise sustainability, simplicity, standardisation, linked-data description and clear licensing over user interface features, in line with Suleman’s keynote presentation at OR2023, while still being able to drive rich, full-featured services when resources allow and fall back to a sustainable core if needed.</p><p>Much of the data we work with is subject to Indigenous Cultural Intellectual Property (ICIP) rights, controlled by First Nations peoples guided by Indigenous data sovereignty principles; we must ensure it is handled in a conscionable and culturally responsible manner.</p><p>Making data Accessible does not always mean Open Access – under both research ethics and the CARE and FAIR principles, data by and about humans needs access control and licensing. Our framework deals with these issues and is built from the ground up to be “as open as possible, as closed as needed”.</p><p>NOTE: Since the abstract was submitted we have adopted the name “Protocols” for the use in work we are doing on tools for FAIR and CARE adoption.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide01.png alt="collect

We do this to avoid drawing boundaries around what is a “repository” vs an “archive” or a Digital Preservation system and to include as many practitioners as possible in the conversation.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide04.png alt=' :: ' title='Slide: 4' border=1 width=85%%><p>The first implementation of this stream of work was the <a href=https://data.research.uts.edu.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">UTS Research Data Portal</a> – this has not been updated for a while due to staffing changes at the university and a lack of ongoing governance that made the data repository dependent on individual people (three of whom are authors of this paper and no longer work for UTS), but as of mid-2024 it is being renovated and revitalised.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide05.png alt title='Slide: 5' border=1 width=85%%><p>This screenshot shows what an LDaCA site looks like; a typical data-discovery portal. Underneath is not a typical (by Open Repositories standards) repository solution like Dspace, Innvenio or EPrints, all of which are more or less monolithic architectures. Following the implementation protocols we will discuss below, data is very much considered separately from the application used to provide views of the Archival Repository.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide06.png alt='LDACA PARADISEC INDEX SCREENSHOT ::  :: ' title='Slide: 6' border=1 width=85%%><p>This slide shows a collage of images from the <a href=https://www.paradisec.org.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">PARADISEC</a> catalogue and some images of the materials that have been digitised.

We then extended the LDaCA data discovery portal to include maps and timelines. This gives the sort of rich, immersive data exploration typical of custom websites.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide08.png alt='Context and history ::  :: ' title='Slide: 8' border=1 width=85%%><p>The work we are presenting here builds on “Arkisto”, an initiative started in 2019 and funded by an ARDC precursor, the Australian National Data Service. Arkisto was an <em>informal</em> collaboration between the University of Technology Sydney and PARADISEC with contributions from AARNet and the State Library of NSW, and resulted in a website that articulated some principles and use cases for designing sustainable repositories. The initial work was presented at OR 2021.
The Arkisto approach is summarised on the home page:
Data on an Arkisto deployment is always available on disc (or object storage) with a complete description independently of any services such as websites or APIs. Once the data is safe and well described, Arkisto has a flexible model for how data can be accessed using a variety of services.
The approach, and the standards it mentioned, the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) (Hankinson et al., 2019) and Research Object RO-Crate (RO-Crate) (Soiland-Reyes et al., 2022), were included in the successful proposal for the Language Data Commons of Australia project, and that project with continued collaboration with PARADISEC and the University of Sydney, has advanced the work.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide09.png alt=' ::  ::  ::  ::  :: Not really a platform, the core idea was a set of principles :: These are two important specifications but we should not have tied Arkisto to just these two :: THIS BIT IS WHAT WE *REALLY* MEANT TO SAY :: ' title='Slide: 9' border=1 width=85%%><p>The Arkisto work was helpful in that it aided in securing funding and was the starting point for principled development of Archival Repository solutions. However, it had a few issues.</p><p>The core idea of Arkisto was indeed a set of principles, but:</p><p>We also presented it as a “Platform” (whatever that is) and tied implementation of the platform to two particular Specifications (which we still use at LDaCA).
The informality of the collaboration became a problem when there were disagreements; the site did not have clear ownership or governance so there was no mechanism for resolving issues or making major changes to the site.
We decided to revisit the Arkisto approach, separating out principles (CARE and FAIR), implementation protocols, and then implementation details such as which specifications are followed and software tools to implement them.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide10.png alt title='Slide: 10' border=1 width=85%%><p>Here we introduce the PILARS protocols, which the lead of the LDaCA project, Professor Michael Haugh, described as a guide to implementing “CAREul FAIRness”, referring to the CARE and FAIR principles.
This is a snapshot of the current draft. The Protocols have a persistent identifier: <a href=http://w3id.org/ldac/pilars target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">http://w3id.org/ldac/pilars</a></p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide11.png alt=' ::  :: ' title='Slide: 11' border=1 width=85%%><p>The <a href=https://www.gida-global.org/care target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">CARE</a> principles frame the <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">FAIR</a> principles with an emphasis on the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and (we think on the LDaCA project) have relevance to any data.</p><blockquote><p>The current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; rights and interests. Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit.</p></blockquote></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide12.png alt=' ::  :: ' title='Slide: 12' border=1 width=85%%><p>PILARS is being managed on GitHub in a public repository, which means anyone can contribute via issues or pull requests.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide13.png alt=' ::  :: ' title='Slide: 13' border=1 width=85%%><p>Setting up the governance is still in progress, but we will be formalising this drawing on the expertise of Robert McLellan - one of the authors of this presentation.

Archival Repositories are not just software packages or application deployments; they need to be seen as social institutions that have the means to persist, and have management and contingency planning in place.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide17.png alt title='Slide: 17' border=1 width=85%%><p>The initial work on establishing Archival Repository infrastructure for the Language Data Commons of Australia focussed on re-housing existing data sets which were in a variety of legacy web applications, with data and metadata locked up in the likes of WordPress and Zope websites. The best of these applications from a migration perspective was the data from Alveo (Burnham et al., 2014); this was available in a Fedora-based repository which was only intermittently available due to support issues and more usefully, a copy of the data stored on disk with linked-data metadata files (N-Triples) allowed us to migrate those collections to the Arkisto standards-stack by cross walking files directly.</p><p>The experience with the Alveo collections, including the largest collection, Austalk (Estival et al., 2014), which had data from around 1000 speakers, totalled 60GB (for metadata and audio) with circa 8 million files, was that having data available on disk with adjacent metadata, free from an API was extremely valuable. We had to develop tooling to migrate data but this was much more straightforward because of the use of standards with available software implementations both in source and target, and the ability to have direct access to the data and metadata from storage.</p><p>Subsequently, the team has been working with other legacy and contemporary research data, most of which has never been archived and does not have standardised metadata. Typically researchers manage this kind of data by keeping it on disk, often with an ad-hoc spreadsheet for metadata. This approach is common to many disciplines; we have dubbed this the “R-Drive” approach, where researchers use local storage, or an institutional research data store (hence the “R”). The following is a simplified workflow infographic developed to assist in communicating the basic principles.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide18.png alt title='Slide: 18' border=1 width=85%%><p>The above diagram shows the current state of known PILARS implementation as of the middle of 2024.</p><p>There are three main open-source toolkits at the moment.</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/oni-ui target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Oni</a> is an open-source portal application for building data portals from RO-Crate data – (we showed screenshots above; most of them look like shopping websites for data) – but Oni sites are extremely flexible in how they are presented.</p><ul><li><p>The Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA)’ s main deployment is the <a href=https://data.ldaca.edu.au target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">LDaCA data portal</a></p></li><li><p>The University of Technology Sydney uses an earlier version of Oni, and is currently being updated to use the LDaCA version.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href=https://nyingarn.net/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nyingarn</a> makes manuscript sources of Australian Indigenous languages available as searchable and reusable text documents to support language revitalisation</p></li></ul><p>We showed screenshots for the <a href=https://omaa-arts.sydney.edu.au/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">OMAA</a> above.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide19.png alt=' ::  :: ' title='Slide: 19' border=1 width=85%%><p>The <a href=https://rrkive.org target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">RRKive</a> website is the project site that will contain additional information about PILARS – how to implement the protocols, open source software, presentations etc. to supplement PILARS.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide20.png alt=' ::  :: Pronunciation guide – talk like it’s the 19th of September  :: ' title='Slide: 20' border=1 width=85%%><p>Note – pronounce the “RR” pirate-fashion.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide21.png alt title='Slide: 21' border=1 width=85%%><p>This slide shows a conceptual architecture for [PARADISEC] with some statistics about its large and important collection.</p></section><section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide' class=or_section><img src=Slide22.png alt=' :: _ something about licensing  :: A summary of the LDaCA architecture vs  :: ' title='Slide: 22' border=1 width=85%%><p>As we are dealing with resources created by people, with inherent rights in what they say and perform, the RRKive approach has a baked-in expectation that <em>access control</em> will be needed, in order to respect ICIP, moral rights and legal and ethical constraints imposed by research institutions and “the law of the land” (although within the so-called Australian context, lands were never ceded by the original long-term custodians, and still today, no legitimate legal instrument, or agreement exists to suggest otherwise) we need to provide mechanisms for authorised data access which is why we engage the above mentioned Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles.
