&lt;p>During a Master of Applied Linguistics degree at &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">UNSW Sydney&lt;/a>, I was given the opportunity to enrol in a course in which students become interns in the School of Humanities and Languages&amp;rsquo; Language Processing Lab. Although I would still have readings and assessments to complete, the teaching model would be different to a standard postgraduate course: I would attend regular online lab meetings with my supervisor and other interns, and design and conduct my own research project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Management in Language Technology: A Case Study of Appen</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/general-resources/case-studies/data-mangement-appen/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 15:12:12 +1100</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/general-resources/case-studies/data-mangement-appen/</guid><description>&lt;p>by &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0006-2241-3377" title="Rosanna is a Senior Research Project Officer in the LDaCA team.

&lt;p>Founded in Sydney in 1996, &lt;a href="https://www.appen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Appen&lt;/a> is a technology company that collects and improves data for the purposes of training and developing machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. During my time at Appen, a significant part of my work involved a diverse range of projects for both automatic speech recognition (&lt;a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/glossary/#asr" title="Automatic Speech Recognition" target="_blank"
 >ASR&lt;/a

 >fieldwork&lt;/a
> experience, in many ways, conforms to stereotypes of language fieldwork – a community outsider working with a smaller language community located far from an urban centre. For my postgraduate research, I documented and described grammatical topics of &lt;a href="https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sude1239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Sudest&lt;/a> (known as Vanga Vanatɨna by its speakers), an Oceanic language spoken in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The language is spoken on the islands of Vanatinai (also known as Sudest and Tagula) and Yeina in the Louisiade Archipelago, approximately 350 kilometres southeast of the PNG mainland. In the following, I discuss decisions I made and processes I followed related to the collection of language data and archiving the resulting &lt;a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/glossary/#corpus" title="A collection of real-life examples of language selected to be a fair representation of the language or a particular linguistic genre." target="_blank"
 >corpus&lt;/a
> of texts, including ethical considerations, ownership of the data, data formats, &lt;a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/glossary/#metadata" title="The information that defines and describes data." target="_blank"
 >metadata&lt;/a
>, and data security and reuse. This is by no means meant as a guide (of best practice) for projects where language data are being collected with speakers of un(der)described languages. Rather, it is an account of some of the types of considerations and procedures that need to be considered when collecting language data and how I handled them in this instance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sydney Speaks</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/general-resources/case-studies/sydney-speaks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 15:53:30 +1100</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/resources/general-resources/case-studies/sydney-speaks/</guid><description>&lt;p>by &lt;a href="https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/travis-ce" title="Catherine Travis is a CI on LDaCA, and Professor of Modern European Languages at the ANU.
