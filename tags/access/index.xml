<p>We will present a standards-based generalized architecture for large-scale data* repositories for research and preservation illustrated with real-world examples drawn from a number of languages and cultural archive projects. This work is taking place in the context of the Australian Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons, particularly the Language Data component thereof and the long-established <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#paradisec" title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target="_blank"
  >PARADISEC</a
> cultural archive. The standards used include the Oxford Common File Layout for storage, Research Object CRATE (<a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#ro-crate" title="Research Object Crate" target="_blank"

  >FAIR</a
> digital objects, and a language data metadata profile to ensure long-term interoperability between systems and re-usability over time.

<p>The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (<a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#atap" title="Australian Text Analytics Platform" target="_blank"
  >ATAP</a
>) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#hass" title="Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences" target="_blank"
  >HASS</a
> (Humanities and Social Sciences) and Indigenous Research Data Commons (HASS+I <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rdc" title="Research Data Commons" target="_blank"
  >RDC</a
>).</p>
<p>The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#data-collection" title="A set of data collected under similar conditions and brought together in a shared framework." target="_blank"
  >data collections</a
> under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#intellectual-property" title="Creative works protected by law via patents, copyright and trademarks." target="_blank"
  >intellectual property</a
> rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.</p>
<p>The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions.</p>
<p>We would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands on which we live and work and the importance of Indigenous knowledge, culture and language to these projects. Peter Sefton lives and works on Wiradjuri land, and for Nick Thieberger and Simon Musgrave, it&rsquo;s the land of the Kulin nation.</p>

<p>This is the data triage process we have been going through in LDaCA — and it should be noted that of all the data we are presented with, most of it needs to be reworked into the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#arkisto" title="A scalable, standards-based platform for sustainable data." target="_blank"

<p>This is the overall architecture for data storage and delivery — missing is how data gets into to the repository, but we’ll come to that later.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>At this point, I will introduce one of the themes of this talk. In March this year, <a href="https://bibwild.wordpress.com/2023/03/21/ocfl-and-source-of-truth-two-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">this blog post was published</a> - looking at the pros and cons of using <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#ocfl" title="Oxford Common File Layout" target="_blank"
  >OCFL</a
> (the Oxford Common File Layout) as the “source of truth” for a system (say a repository).</p>
<p>We are very much taking the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#ocfl" title="Oxford Common File Layout" target="_blank"
  >OCFL</a
> (that is file-in-storage-as-the-source-of-truth) approach in LDaCA. Which begs the question: “But doesn’t that mean that it’s very specific to language data?” No, because we’re using a very flexible, extensible, discipline-neutral format for data description – yes, we have ways to specialise metadata and interfaces to language and other cultural metadata, but NO, the systems are not locked-in to that mode of operation. This means we should be able to share development and maintenance more broadly than with a single archive.</p>
<p>Two main points we want to get across in this presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are taking seriously the idea that data-in-storage should be “batteries included” – everything needed to preserve and use the data is stored together and systems can be reconstituted from this storage.</li>
<li>This approach IS generic – different vocabularies/schemas can be plugged in by design.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>So let&rsquo;s now start looking at the standards involved in the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#arkisto" title="A scalable, standards-based platform for sustainable data." target="_blank"
  >Arkisto</a
> approach. This is a slide from “What is RO-Crate” – The dataset may contain any kind of data resource about anything, in any format as a file or URL</p>

</section>

<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>The core standard for this work is <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#ro-crate" title="Research Object Crate" target="_blank"
  >RO-Crate</a
> (Research Object Crate) in which all data is input, stored and output. This a big step for eresearch systems – no longer is there a transformation step on <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#data-onboarding" title="The process by which language collections are catalogued in LDaCA." target="_blank"
  >data onboarding</a
> (we used the term ingest, but some project members and partners found the metaphor distasteful).</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>This screenshot is a bit of (undated) DSpace documentation found following a tip from Kim Sheppard – we have included it here to illustrate that storing additional metadata (in this case METS) for an object was done by convention. Using a linked-data system means that we no longer have to do this kind of thing – there’s still one magic file name in <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#ro-crate" title="Research Object Crate" target="_blank"
  >RO-Crate</a
> but it’s only one for the metadata and one for the HTML preview – everything else is labelled and extensible.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>In the early days of the “Open Repositories” movement repositories had Dublin Core metadata (a standard with a few different flavours).</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>These days using linked data it is no longer necessary to have a bevy of <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#xml" title="Extensible Markup Language" target="_blank"
  >XML</a
> schemas with incompatible encodings to store data from different schemas, different vocabularies and ontologies can co-exist and be expressed in a common way.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>In the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#paradisec" title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target="_blank"
  >PARADISEC</a
> system, this is achieved by storing files on disk in a simple hierarchy - with metadata and other resources stored together in a directory - this scheme allows for hands-on management of data resources, independently of the software used to serve them.</p>
<p>This approach means that if the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#paradisec" title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target="_blank"
  >PARADISEC</a
> software-stack becomes un-maintainable for financial or technical reasons the important resources, the data, are stored safely on disk with their metadata and a new access portal could be constructed relatively easily.</p>
<p>Despite the valuable features of this solution, it is not generalisable. The metadata.xml is custom to <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#paradisec" title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target="_blank"
  >PARADISEC</a
>, as is the software stack.</p>
<p>In 2019 <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#paradisec" title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target="_blank"
  >PARADISEC</a
> and the eResearch team at UTS received small grants from the Australian National Data Service and began collaborating on an approach to managing archival repositories which built on this <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#paradisec" title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target="_blank"
  >PARADISEC</a
> approach of storing metadata with data.</p>

  >PARADISEC</a

<p>Here, for comparison is <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/FEDORA6x/Fedora&#43;OCFL&#43;Object&#43;Structure#FedoraOCFLObjectStructure-FedoraAtomicResource-Container" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">how Fedora 6 would store an object (an Atomic Resource in Fedora-speak) like this with multiple files</a>.

<p>This slide shows the interface between our core standards – a compliant <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#ocfl" title="Oxford Common File Layout" target="_blank"

</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>This slide illustrates the flexibility of the approach we’re taking. As LDaCA is a national project, our archival repositories and those of our partners such as <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#paradisec" title="Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures" target="_blank"
  >PARADISEC</a
> will be distributed with differences of governance, varying by organisation, language type and discipline, though there is still a desire to be able to aggregate data into services that make it findable.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>The storage services may not all be the same in this model, some may be file systems, some may be object stores, and they may be hosted by and governed by a variety of organizations.</p>

<p>This slide shows how we have abstracted the “A” for Access in <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#fair" title="Four key principles developed in 2016 with the aim of supporting the discovery and reuse of research data." target="_blank"
  >FAIR</a
> out of the repository and into a separate centralised or at least <em>concentrated</em> system. We have a <a href="../fair-care-eresearch-2022/" rel="">full write-up of this approach from the 2022 eResearch Australasia conference</a> and we don’t have time to go through it in detail here, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every object in the repository has a Data Reuse License with some management metadata.</li>
<li>Each repository only needs an authoritative list of licenses and trusted license management systems to be able to serve the data.</li>
<li>License management is handled by a dedicated system that can deal with application and invitation workflows to grant licenses (including simple self-serve click-through license agreements)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that our work is also informed by the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#care" title="Four key principles developed for respectful handling of Indigenous data." target="_blank"

<p>Let’s revisit this diagram. What’s missing?</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>In the first phase of the LDaCA project, work focused on batch import of data using tools to convert collections – this approach was used on contemporary collections as well as for “rescuing” collections from older repository systems.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>This slide shows some JSON-LD metadata that describes the way this <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#ro-crate" title="Research Object Crate" target="_blank"
  >RO-Crate</a
> metadata was created – illustrating how <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#ro-crate" title="Research Object Crate" target="_blank"

> can be used to record <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#provenance" title="The documented history or chain of custody of materials from their creation to their current location within a collection." target="_blank"
  >provenance</a
>.</p>
<p>(UPDATE: I didn&rsquo;t explain <a href="https://json-ld.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">JSON-LD</a> properly during the presentation. JSON-LD is a method of encoding linked-data (which can be quite esoteric and unapproachable) in <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#json" title="JavaScript Object Notation" target="_blank"
  >JSON</a

  >Crate-O</a

<p>(At this stage <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#crate-o" title="A browser-based editor for RO-Crates." target="_blank"

<p>In conclusion, we have given a quick tour of a standards-based repository stack (loosely called <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#arkisto" title="A scalable, standards-based platform for sustainable data." target="_blank"
  >Arkisto</a

  >PARADISEC</a
> projects, but along the way have tried to emphasise that this is generic, re-usable architecture – and is based on standards. By using an extensible metadata standard with a growing community, and a storage-layer standard forged from an acquired aversion to systems migration we aim to reduce the risk to very important cultural data by working with as many communities as possible on software tools, so that we reduce cost and risk for all of us.</p>

<p>The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (<a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#atap" title="Australian Text Analytics Platform" target="_blank"
  >ATAP</a
>) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (<a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#hass" title="Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences" target="_blank"
  >HASS</a
> <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rdc" title="Research Data Commons" target="_blank"
   >RDC</a
 >).</p>
<p>The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#data-collection" title="A set of data collected under similar conditions and brought together in a shared framework." target="_blank"
  >data collections</a
> under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#intellectual-property" title="Creative works protected by law via patents, copyright and trademarks." target="_blank"
  >intellectual property</a
> rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.</p>
<p>The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Culture at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions.</p>

<p>Last year at eResearch Australasia, the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) team presented a design for a distributed access control system which could look after the A-is-for-accessible in <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#fair" title="Four key principles developed in 2016 with the aim of supporting the discovery and reuse of research data." target="_blank"
  >FAIR</a
> data; in this presentation, we describe and demonstrate a pilot system based on that design, showing how <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#data-license" title="A legal arrangement specifying what users can do with the data." target="_blank"
  >data licenses</a
> that allow access by identified groups of people to language <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#data-collection" title="A set of data collected under similar conditions and brought together in a shared framework." target="_blank"
  >data collections</a
> can be used with an AAF pilot system (CILogon) to give the right people access to data resources.</p>
<p>The <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#ardc" title="Australian Research Data Commons" target="_blank"
  >ARDC</a
> have invested in a pilot of this work as part of the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#hass" title="Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences" target="_blank"
  >HASS</a
> Research Data Commons and Indigenous Research Capability Program integration activities.</p>
<p>The system has to be able to implement data access policies with real-world complexity and one of our challenges has been developing a data access policy that works across a range of different collections of language data. Here we present a pilot data access policy that we have developed, describing how this policy captures the decisions that must be made by a range of data providers to ensure data accessibility that complies with diverse legal, moral and ethical considerations.
We will discuss how the <a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CARE</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">FAIR</a> principles underpin this work, and compare this work to other projects such as <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/cadre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CADRE</a>, which promise to deliver more complex solutions in the future. Initial work is with collections curated in a research context but we will also address community access to these resources.</p>
<p>The idea is to separate safe storage of data from its delivery. Each item in a repository is stored with <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#licensing" title="A process that allows the copyright owner to share the right to access and use the data without reassigning the ownership of the copyright of the work." target="_blank"
  >licensing</a
> information in natural language (English at the moment, but could be other languages) and the repository defers access decisions to an Authorization system, where data custodians can design whatever process they like for granting license access. This can range from simple click-through licenses where anyone can agree to license terms, to detailed multi-step workflows where applicants are vetted based on whatever criteria the rights holder wishes; qualifications, membership of a cultural group, have they paid a subscription fee, etc</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>Regarding rights, our project is informed by the <a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CARE</a> principles for Indigenous data which also describe the level of respect which should be given to any data collected from individuals or communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; rights and interests. Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#fair" title="Four key principles developed in 2016 with the aim of supporting the discovery and reuse of research data." target="_blank"
  >FAIR</a
>: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>We are designing the system so that it can work with diverse ways of expressing access rights, for example, we are considering how the approach described here could be extended based on the likes of the <a href="https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Traditional Knowledge labels</a>, incorporating them into the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#data-license" title="A legal arrangement specifying what users can do with the data." target="_blank"

<p>In this talk, we look at a case study with the <a href="https://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/sydney-speaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Sydney Speaks project</a> via LDaCA steering committee member Professor <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1410-3268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Catherine Travis</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project seeks to document and explore Australian English, as spoken in Australia’s largest and most ethnically and linguistically diverse city – Sydney.
The title “Sydney Speaks” captures a key defining feature of the project: the data come from recorded conversations between Sydney siders, as they tell stories about their lives and experiences, their opinions and attitudes. This allows us to measure how their lived experiences impact their speech patterns.
Working within the framework of variationist sociolinguistics, we examine variation in phonetics, grammar and discourse, in an effort to answer questions of fundamental interest both to Australian English, and language variation and change more broadly, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How has Australian English as spoken in Sydney changed over the past 100 years?</li>
<li>Has the change in the ethnic diversity over that time period (and in particular, over the past 40 years) had any impact on the way Australian English is spoken?</li>
<li>What affects the way variation and change spread through society - Who are the initiators and who are the leaders in change? - How do social networks function in a modern metropolis? - What social factors are relevant to Sydney speech today, and over time (gender? class? region? ethnic identity?)
A better understanding of what kind of variation exists in Australian English, and of how and why Australian English has changed over time can help society be more accepting of speech variation and even help address prejudices based on ways of speaking.

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The collection contains recordings of people speaking, both contemporary and historic.</p>
<p>Because this involved human participants there are restrictions on the distribution of data - a situation we see with lots of studies involving people in a huge range of disciplines.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>There are four tiers of data access we need to enforce and observe for this data based on the participant agreements and ethics arrangements under which the data were collected.</p>
<p>Concerns about rights and interests are important for any data involving people - and a large amount of the data both Indigenous and non-Indigenous we are using will require access control that ensures that data is shared with the right users under the right conditions.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go over some basics, starting with <em>licenses</em>.</p>
<p>A license in this context is <em>a natural language document</em> in which a copyright holder sets out the terms and conditions of use for data. Licenses <em>may</em> have metadata that describes them, e.g. a property to say that this is an open license (and does not require a check when serving data).</p>
<p>A license is not a computer program, or configuration, or an AI entity that can make decisions, it’s a legal document. You may also know this as a “data sharing agreement” or “terms of use”. Examples of licenses we see all the time are the GNU GPL or the various <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#creative-commons-licenses" title="A set of licenses that allow for data reusability under specified conditions." target="_blank"
  >Creative Commons licenses</a
> which grant rights to others to redistribute a creative work, and specifies conditions on what changes are permitted.</p>
<p>That said, metadata <em>about</em> a license can be used to automate decision-making - if it is labelled as being an open license, then a repository can serve data and include that data, if it is labelled as “closed” or more aptly, “authorization-required” then repository software can perform an authorization step, which we cover in detail later.</p>
<p>In the world of research data generated by or about human participants, licenses can’t always allow unauthenticated access and data redistribution, and they may permit distribution only to certain people, classes or person. Some data, for example (particularly that which has not been or cannot be de-identified) can only be made available to the original research team.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>(Dall-e prompt: A sad dog sitting on an iceberg, XKCD)</p>
<p>So, a license is a document that expresses conditions such as “Data can be used by other researchers”, but unfortunately we don’t have systems in the research-data ecosystem which can automatically identify a user as “a researcher” (this may be surprising to some, but the Australian Access Federation can, at this stage, only say that someone has an account with an institution - it can’t tell a professor from a student administration officer and there are certainly no lists of “certified linguists”).</p>
<p>Here are some cold hard facts:</p>
<p>We don’t have an authority that can identify someone as a researcher,</p>
<p>Or a “linguist”,</p>
<p>Or an “anthropologist”,</p>
<p>Or a member of an <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#arc" title="Australian Research Council" target="_blank"
  >ARC</a
> (Australian Research Council) research project,</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/cadre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CADRE</a> project is working on systems that will eventually support all these things, but they are not available as services yet, and their initial focus is on government data, so we have to work out ways for our data custodians to make decisions on who is considered an “other researcher” in the absence of attribute-based authentication.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>The access control system we have been prototyping is based on licenses.</p>
<p>For any data object, which could be an entire collection, or one set of recordings of a speaker in a speech study, or a set of handwritten linguistic field notes from the 1950s, or a novel etc we store a license with it. This means that future archivists/librarians and researchers can work out how to manage the data if the systems we build today for automated access are no longer operational and we give the license an ID which is a URL we can use to identify it uniquely.</p>
<p>This diagram shows how a license is explicitly linked to the data using a metadata description standard known as “Research Object Crate” <a href="http://ptsefton.com/2019/11/05/RO-Crate%20eResearch%20Australasia%202019/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">RO-Crate</a>. Each object in the repository is a crate, with a metadata file that describes the object and (optionally) its component files, including the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#data-license" title="A legal arrangement specifying what users can do with the data." target="_blank"
  >data license</a
>.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>(This diagram has been updated from the one presented at eResearch to show two portals instead of one)</p>
<p>Every item in a repository has a license, which may be an open one like CC Share Alike or a custom license derived from the ethics and participants agreements for a study in the context of local laws and institutional policy.</p>
<p>Using this license, distributed access portals in our architecture can check against an authorization system for each request for data. The portals may both host data with the same <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#licensing" title="A process that allows the copyright owner to share the right to access and use the data without reassigning the ownership of the copyright of the work." target="_blank"
  >licensing</a
> but do not need to maintain access control lists.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>(Images: Various baskets of puppies by DALL-E)</p>
<p>When we first developed access controls for LDaCA in 2021 it was a requirement that <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#data-license" title="A legal arrangement specifying what users can do with the data." target="_blank"
  >data licensing</a
> and access control decisions be decoupled from each other, and from particular repository software. The usual approach in repositories is to build in a local access-control system, but this is tied to a particular implementation and will not work in a distributed environment where there are multiple different repositories, and services such as computational resources that researchers need to access to process data.</p>
<p>We could not find an available open-source system for managing license-based access to data, so our starting approach used groups as a proxy for granting licenses on that basis that all common user-directory services such as LDAP include the concept of user groups.</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>simplest possible license-based approach to access control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOT attempting to be attribute-based as that is not currently feasible within our project scope (see <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/cadre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CADRE</a> for progress in that direction)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first prototype, which we presented at eResearch Australasia last year was a proof-of-concept <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#github" title="A developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code, using Git software." target="_blank"
  >GitHub</a
>-based system. This demonstrated that authorization can be delegated from a repository to an external service. For each of the Sydney Speaks licenses there was a <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#github" title="A developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code, using Git software." target="_blank"
  >GitHub</a
> group (organization). The repository, when requested to serve data would get the user to log in using the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#github" title="A developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code, using Git software." target="_blank"
  >GitHub</a
> Authentication services, then check if the user was in the correct license group.</p>
<p>This worked, but there were issues with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are no workflow options (unless we build a workflow system), just adding people to a <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#github" title="A developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code, using Git software." target="_blank"
  >GitHub</a
> organisation to pre-authorize them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system only supported a single logon service, which is not widely used in academia or by community groups</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we talked to our colleagues at the Australian Access Federation (AAF) about a supported, research-sector-wide service.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>The AAF, as it happened were already working with other research groups on a service called <a href="https://www.cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CILogon</a> (hosted in the USA initially, but soon to be hosted in Australia), like <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#github" title="A developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code, using Git software." target="_blank"
  >GitHub</a
>, this service has groups (which was our way of associating users with licenses in the absence of a specific license-granting service), but also allows users to log in with a variety of Authentication providers, including research institutions, via the Australian Access Federation as well as social logins such as Google and Microsoft (and our old friend <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#github" title="A developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code, using Git software." target="_blank"
  >GitHub</a
>).</p>
<p>Again this worked, but the current version of CILogon does not have particularly easy-to-use ways for a license-holder to create groups - there are a number of abstract constructs to deal with and there is currently no way to build an approval workflow using the web interface, so as with the <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#github" title="A developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code, using Git software." target="_blank"
  >GitHub</a
> trial we would have needed to build this part (all of this may change, as the software is under constant development).</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://youtu.be/xEWXiM-jUfY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">nine-minute silent video</a> of what this looked like on YouTube for those who are really interested.</p>
<p>AAF is engaging with our project on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a cloud-based authentication and authorisation infrastructure (AAI) to support the needs of the project</li>
<li>understand and develop business process documentation for authorising access to data and services</li>
<li>configure the AAI to support these business processes and to develop extensions to facilitate new functionality that may be required</li>
<li>create a set of policies, standards and guidelines for managing researchers’ identity and access management</li>
<li>develop support documentation, train community representatives to operate the platform, and provide support to the community managers.
The AAF has recommended CILogon &amp; <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rems" title="Resource Entitlement Management System" target="_blank"
  >REMS</a
> as potential solutions to investigate &amp; prototype</li>
</ul>
<p>CILogon is a federated identity management platform that provides the following features:
support for institutional and community logins
cross-institutional and community collaboration
federated identity and group management
a community management dashboard
OIDC connectors for downstream services that support authorisation claims for services like
<a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rems" title="Resource Entitlement Management System" target="_blank"
  >REMS</a
>, <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#binderhub" title="A Kubernetes-based cloud service that allows users to share reproducible interactive computing environments from code repositories." target="_blank"

<p>Recently (after the abstract for this presentation was submitted) the AAF team made us aware of the Resource Entitlement Management System, <a href="https://github.com/CSCfi/rems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">REMS</a>, which is an open-source application out of Finland. This software is the missing link for LDaCA in that it allows a data custodian to grant licenses to users. And it works with CILogon as an Authentication layer so we can let users log in using a variety of services.</p>
<p>At the core of <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rems" title="Resource Entitlement Management System" target="_blank"
  >REMS</a
> is a set of Licenses which can then be associated with Resources - in our design, this is (almost always) a one-to-one correspondence, for example, we would have a license “Sydney Speaks Data Researcher Access License” corresponding to a resource that represents ALL data with that license. These Resources can then be made available through a catalogue, and workflows can be set up for pre-authorization processes ranging from single-click authorizations where a user just accepts a license and a bot approves it, to complex forms where users upload credentials and one or more data custodians approve their request, and grant them the license.</p>
<p>It also has features for revoking permissions, and has a full <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#api" title="Application Programming Interface" target="_blank"
  >API</a
> so admin tasks can be automated (for us that’s in the future).</p>
<p>Once a user has been granted a license in a pre-authorization process then a repository can authorize access to a resource by checking with <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rems" title="Resource Entitlement Management System" target="_blank"
  >REMS</a
> to see if a given user is pre-authorized. That is, has been granted a license. Note that users do not have to find <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rems" title="Resource Entitlement Management System" target="_blank"
  >REMS</a
> on their own - they will be directed to it from data and computing services when they need to apply for pre-authorization.</p>

  >REMS</a

<p>Not shown here are some design and preparation steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The research team read their ethics approval and participant agreements and craft one or more access agreements (AKA licenses) for a data set (NOTE: If the data can be made available automatically with just a license attached, such as when all parties have agreed that data can be Creative commons licensed, or the data is in the public domain then the following steps are not required)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The research team and support staff add the license to <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rems" title="Resource Entitlement Management System" target="_blank"
  >REMS</a
>, creating a “resource” a virtual offering that corresponds to any dataset that has the above license</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The research team add a workflow to <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rems" title="Resource Entitlement Management System" target="_blank"
  >REMS</a
> - this could range from an auto-approved click-through where users can agree to license terms, through to detailed (manual) checking of their credentials.</p>

<p>(This section was added after the conference, to try to summarize the discussion and clarify requirements by starting an FAQ on this approach)</p>
<br>
<h2 id="q-why-not-just-implement-an-access-control-list-acl-in-the-repository">Q: Why not &ldquo;just&rdquo; implement an access control list (ACL) in the repository?</h2>
<p>There are a few reasons for the distributed approach we have taken in LDaCA:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ACLs need maintenance over time - people&rsquo;s identities change, they retire and die, so storing a list of identifiers such as email addresses alongside content is not a viable long-term preservation strategy. Rather, we will encourage data custodians to describe in words what are permitted uses for the data, and by whom, in a license, then allow whomever is the current data custodian to manage that access in a separate administrative system. We expect these administrative systems to be ephemeral, and change over time but also to generate less friction over time as standards are developed. Expected future benefits of concentrating these processes will include that people do not have to prove the same claims they make about themselves multiple times and that it is easier for data custodians to authorize access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LDaCA data will be stored in a variety of places with separate portal applications serving data for specific purposes; if these systems all have in-built authorization schemes, even if they are the same, then we have the problem of synchronizing access control lists around a network of services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessing data that requires some sort of authorization process is not language or humanities-specific, so working with an existing application that can handle pre-authorization workflows and access-control authorization decisions is an attractive choice and should allow LDaCA to take advantage of centrally managed services with functionality that improves over time rather than having to develop and maintain our own systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If complex access controls are implemented inside a system then there is a risk that data becomes stranded inside that system and cannot be reused without completely re-implementing the access control. For example, imagine an archive of cultural material with complex access controls encoded into the business logic such as “this item is accessible only to male initiates”. Applications like this need to store user accounts with attributes on both data and user records that can be used to authorize access. There is a high risk of data being stranded in a system such as this if it is no longer supported. This will be mitigated somewhat if the rules are also expressed as licenses, perhaps a composition of Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels - but the access system is baked-in to the application and not portable.</p>

<h2 id="q-yes-but-why-does-data-need-to-have-a-license-if-we-already-have-access-controls">Q: Yes but why does data need to have a license if we already have access controls?</h2>
<p>The point of Research Data Commons projects like LDaCA is to create an ecosystem where data can be re-used. For language data, this means that users, including researchers and community members, will be able to download data for certain authorised purposes and activities. The license is the way that data custodians communicate to data users (and future administrators) what those purposes and activities are.</p>
<p>A license, which is always packaged with data will allow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A user to inspect a five-year-old dataset in their downloads folder and work out what they are allowed to do with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An IT professional to clean up a laptop that has been handed in by (or seized from – it happens) a departing faculty member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A developer to re-create an access control replacing a decommissioned system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 id="q-so-many-licenses-sounds-like-a-lot-of-work">Q: So many licenses! Sounds like a lot of work!</h2>
<p>We expect that the overhead of writing licenses will diminish greatly over time and standard clauses and complete licenses will be established. A data depositor will be able to choose from a set of standard license terms (such as a standard “restricted to CIs and participants license” for a given repository, using that as a template to mint their own license for a given data set with its own name and ID. The user can choose a standard way of adding pre-authorized licensees (such as email invitations). This ID can then be used by an authorization system.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="q-so-you-have-centralized-authorization-into-a-system-that-grants-licenses-doesnt-that-mean-you-are-locked-in-to-that-system">Q: So you have centralized authorization into a system that grants licenses doesn&rsquo;t that mean you are locked-in to that system?</h2>
<p>No, and Yes</p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, there is no lock-in regarding the list of Licenses and pre-authorized users; licenses and access control lists can be exported via an <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#api" title="Application Programming Interface" target="_blank"
  >API</a
> so it is possible to import them into another system or save them for audit purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, there is lock-in, in that at this stage the workflow used to give access to users is specific to the system (such as <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rems" title="Resource Entitlement Management System" target="_blank"
  >REMS</a
>)</p>
<p><strong>But</strong>, because our process requires a governance step <em>first</em> in writing a license, then there is a statement of intent for re-building those processes later if needed - a step which is very likely to be missing in a system with built-in access control.</p>
<p>Also, over time, we expect the administrative burden of constructing workflows will become less as standards are developed for a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Licenses can be made less complex (particularly in the context of academic studies) if they specify re-use by particular known cohorts in advance - this comes down to improving the design of studies to encourage data reuse. This may also help to simplify academic ethics processes in the medium to long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#cadre" title="Coordinated Access for Data, Researchers and Environments" target="_blank"
  >CADRE</a
> project is looking to improve pre-authorization workflows that automatically source relevant information about potential users - fetching their publication record, and potentially remembering what certifications they have, so these attributes can be used and reused for decision-making. It is conceivable that this approach might be useful in cultural contexts as well to allow data custodians to manage data sharing - this is a discussion we have yet to have in the broader <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#hass" title="Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences" target="_blank"
  >HASS</a
> <a href="/resources/general-resources/glossary/#rdc" title="Research Data Commons" target="_blank"

<h2 id="q-what-if-i-have-a-really-simple-requirement-like-giving-access-to-just-a-couple-of-people---doesnt-this-license-approach-just-add-complexity">Q: What if I have a really simple requirement like giving access to just a couple of people - doesn’t this license approach just add complexity?</h2>
<p>If a data item needs to be locked down to a small group of people, say the chief investigator and the participants in a recorded dialogue then an obvious implementation is to maintain a small access control list (ACL) for the item. But all of the issues identified above with application-specific ACLs are the same, no matter the size of the cohort: the data set can’t be access controlled outside of its home system. If the system is no longer running then the data may be completely inaccessible, and if there is no license document stored with the data setting out terms of re-use in general terms then there is no indication to future administrators about who, if anyone, should have access of the data.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="q-we-dont-need-a-license-we-have-a-terms-of-use">Q: We don’t need a license, we have a “terms of use”</h2>
<p>Same thing. Terms of use for data are what a license does. We are designing our systems so that all the relevant terms and conditions go in one place to minimize confusion.</p>

<p>The final three slides have been contributed by co-author Patrick.</p>
<p>These slides briefly outline the AAF process for the next phase that will provide the foundations for the development of the service and the creation of those policies to support the community and the service.</p>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>This process will support the project to deliver a viable service that meets researchers’ needs and is trusted by the community and the participants to safely distribute data to authorised persons.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>The AAF’s business analyst is conducting interviews with the key stakeholders.
This discovery process will collect information on the current and the “to-be” state of the service.</p>
<p>Together these will establish goals and expectations and provide the basis for further prototyping a service that meets stakeholder needs.</p>
<p>The process will facilitate the building of a service that empowers the data custodians, the communities and participants to manage access.</p>
</section>
<br>
<section typeof='http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Slide'>

<p>The basis for prototyping is iterative:
Identify
Prioritise
Pilot
Review
Update requirements</p>
<p>This leads to a production service that meets participant, community and researcher requirements and unifies the services, policies and trust framework for the community.</p>
