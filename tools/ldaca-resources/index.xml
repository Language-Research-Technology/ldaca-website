Highlights include:
Metadata Editor Crate-O: A tool that allows you to create and update RO-Crates using a web interface, and with metadata spreadsheets. It provides researchers with a relatively simple way to describe their data using the best practices in formal metadata description.
Data Storage OCFL-js, a library that implements OCFL: A specification for laying out digital collections on file or object storage.</description></item><item><title>Metadata</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/metadata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 15:49:31 +1100</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/metadata/</guid><description>Metadata is often defined as &amp;lsquo;data about data&amp;rsquo;. High-quality metadata is important in making data FAIR:
Findable: metadata is the starting point for searching data collections. For example, if we want to find data in a particular language, this will only be possible for data that has a language recorded in its metadata. (Tracking languages is in itself problematic, see example.) Accessible: access conditions that apply to data should be part of the associated metadata.</description></item><item><title>LDaCA Resources</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 15:01:37 +1100</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/</guid><description>Information and guidance for data custodians and data collectors produced by LDaCA.

Purpose Data governance defines policies, roles, responsibilities and procedures for ongoing use and storage of data, as well as for access to data. Effective data governance maximises sustainability, while ensuring data integrity and protecting research participants. Long-term sustainability requires a data management plan.</description></item><item><title>Data Onboarding Process</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/data-onboarding-process/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 13:59:34 +1100</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/data-onboarding-process/</guid><description>Purpose Onboarding Process 1. Initiating contact between LDaCA and Data Stewards 2. Work Plan 3. Determining appropriate governance and access conditions 4. Preparing data for cataloguing in LDaCA 5. Ongoing engagement See the LDaCA Glossary for definitions of key terms and concepts.
Purpose This document outlines the standards and processes that support the onboarding of language collections to LDaCA. A successful onboarding will result in the collection being catalogued with LDaCA and made available in accordance with the specified access conditions.</description></item><item><title>Access Policy</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/access-policy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 12:49:58 +1100</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/access-policy/</guid><description>Purpose 1.

Purpose This document outlines the LDaCA Access Policy, which is developed to accommodate the goal of making data appropriately accessible, in accordance with legal, moral and ethical considerations of data sharing, and tailored to meet the needs and requirements of different data collections.</description></item><item><title>Determining Access Conditions</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/determining-access-conditions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 12:07:19 +1100</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/determining-access-conditions/</guid><description>Step 1: Consider access condition(s) for the entire collection Step 2: Organise relevant materials Step 3: Define the license terms Step 4: Determine authorisation level Options for access by application See the LDaCA Glossary for definitions of key terms and concepts.
LDaCA recommends the following workflow to determine the access conditions to be outlined in the license. Examples of existing data access licenses can be found here.
Step 1: Consider access condition(s) for the entire collection Do the same access conditions apply to the entire collection?</description></item><item><title>Obtaining a DOI</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/obtaining-a-doi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 15:42:57 +1000</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/tools/ldaca-resources/obtaining-a-doi/</guid><description>See the LDaCA Glossary for definitions of key terms and concepts.
How do I get a DOI for my dataset? Through the collection’s custodial organisation:
Identify the collection’s custodial organisation – a university or research organisation that funded, sponsored, published, approved, or has a current or historical stakeholder interest in the research project that collected the data.
In many cases, contacting the university library about getting a DOI for a dataset is a good starting point.</description></item></channel></rss>
