LDaCA Newsletter — Quarter 2 2024WelcomeWelcome to the second issue for 2024 of this newsletter about the activities of the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP). This quarter, we highlight the LDaCA draft project plan and co-design workshop report published by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), and report back from several exciting events, including the ARDC’s Computational Skills Summer School 2024 and a tech team visit to Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education. If you have any questions or feedback, please email us at ldaca@uq.edu.au or message us on our LinkedIn page. NewsNew content on websiteWe have added two new pieces of content to our website: a case study about data management in language technology, based on projects at tech company Appen. a blog post about why the Australian National Corpus is not a single collection within LDaCA. LDaCA draft project planOn 14 March, the ARDC released draft project plans for the next phase of the HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons (HASS\u0026I RDC), including a plan for the LDaCA project. They were seeking feedback from the public on project activities planned for the next four years. Feedback closed on 22 March, and once this feedback has been reviewed and incorporated, final project plans will be released in the coming months. Meanwhile, the draft plans are still available to view online. Co-designing a digital future for Indigenous language materialsRobert McLellan and his team are seeking Indigenous language champions who are working with language materials for a research project called “Co-designing a digital future for Indigenous language materials”. We plan to run a series of Zoom and face-to-face interviews to find out what works well and what doesn’t work when finding, accessing and using Indigenous language materials. We know that there are challenges involved with accessing and using language materials stored in various locations. We want to contribute to making that data more findable and usable so that it can support and enhance the language work currently being undertaken. So, we are seeking input to help build language platforms, spaces and tools that suit Indigenous language workers and communities. If you are interested or would like to know more, please take a minute to get in touch through our Contact Form. All interviewees will receive a gift voucher worth $70 as a thank you for their time. Graduate Digital Research Fellowship programThe Graduate Digital Research Fellowship (GDRF) program ran very successfully in 2023. We are hoping to build on this success, with three fellows from The University of Queensland (UQ) participating in the 2024 program: Lu Jin is a PhD candidate in architecture and urban design. Her multidisciplinary work will design urban green infrastructural networks in a circular food system for city resilience and sustainability. In the GDRF program, Lu will be applying machine learning methods to identify and assess green cover in street view images. David Gilchrist is a PhD candidate in journalism.

These documents are the outcome of wonderful work by project members at the Australian National University: Catherine Travis, Li Nguyen and Cale Johnstone. Rosanna Smith (LDaCA User Design Analyst) prepared the material for online publication. 2024 Graduate Digital Research Fellowship ProgramIn the last five years, the University of Queensland (UQ) has hosted several iterations of a Graduate Digital Research Fellowship program focused on researchers in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS). In 2023, the program ran under the auspices of ATAP. Two members of our UQ team, Sam Hames (Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Computational Humanities) and Simon Musgrave (Engagement Lead for ATAP and LDaCA), led the program and four students participated. You can read more about the history of the program and the 2023 cohort in this blog post. Image: LDaCA The program will run again in 2024 as an LDaCA activity, supporting research students to explore the possibilities of digital scholarship, particularly in HASS. Our Fellows are students undertaking extended research projects who spend 12–15 weeks learning about digital and computational skills in order to enhance their current research topic or to work on an independent digital project. They explore digital research methods in areas including, but not limited to: computational analysis of text creation of new software tools to support their specific research area social media analytics assessment and analysis of digital environments including mobile apps online games as social and cultural objects. The Fellows meet regularly in activities to develop a sound understanding of digital research methods and tools, including seminars, reading groups and training works","date":"2023-09-15","objectID":"/news/newsletter/newsletter-q1-2024/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"LDaCA Newsletter Quarter 1 2024","uri":"/news/newsletter/newsletter-q1-2024/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Back to Newsletters \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e LDaCA Newsletter - Quarter 4 2023 Campaign URL Copy Twitter 0 tweets Subscribe Past Issues RSS Translate English العربية Afrikaans беларуская мова български català 中文（简体） 中文（繁體） Hrvatski Česky Dansk eesti keel Nederlands Suomi Français Deutsch Ελληνική हिन्दी Magyar Gaeilge Indonesia íslenska Italiano 日本語 ភាសាខ្មែរ 한국어 македонски јазик بهاس ملايو Malti Norsk Polski Português Português - Portugal Română Русский Español Kiswahili Svenska עברית Lietuvių latviešu slovenčina slovenščina српски தமிழ் ภาษาไทย Türkçe Filipino украї́нська Tiếng Việt LDaCA Newsletter | Quarter 4, 202306/10/23 Welcome Welcome to the second issue of this newsletter.

NewsARDC All Staff MeetingARDC held an event in Melbourne last month for all of their staff. Michael Haugh and Robert McLellan were invited to present at the event about working with the ARDC on LDaCA. Their presentation, which was very well received, was part of a showcase of projects in the ARDC's three thematic data commons (Planet, People, HASS and Indigenous). Image Credit: ARDC Event at the Australian Linguistic Society ConferenceWe will be holding a meeting during the Australian Linguistics Society 2023 Conference to provide an update on the activities of the project. This event will take place at lunchtime on the last day of the conference (Friday December 1), venue TBC. New Team Members Two people have joined our team in the last quarter, Otis Carmichael and Rosanna Smith and we will let them introduce themselves: Hi there, my name’s Otis Carmichael, I’m a Waanyi man from Brisbane and a technical designer on the LDaCA team. My initial involvement with the team was to design the team’s logo and other promotional material, however I am now involved in Community Engagement and working on design throughout the website and tools. I’m excited to be on board with the project because I believe that it has potential to really support the domain of language research, by helping to ensure that research data is stored in a more sustainable manner and thus will remain accessible for the language’s community. Hi, my name's Rosanna Smith and I'm a user design analyst on the LDaCA team, based in Melbourne. My background is in linguistics, having managed a variety of language projects for use in machine learning development and language technology. I’m excited to contribute to a project such as LDaCA that is guided fundamentally by FAIR and CARE principles, as well as the opportunity to apply my previous experience and further promote diversity and accessibility in language data management and research. EventsForthcoming Events Workshop on immigrant language corpora in Australia When: 9-10 November, 2023 Where: Onsite. ANU, Acton, ACT 2601 Guest speakers: John Hajek, Ingrid Piller, Sophie Loy-Wilson, Adrian Vickers Australia has long been seen as one of the world’s most multilingual and multicultural societies, with more than 490 languages coming from around 300 ancestries and cultural traditions (ABS, 2021, 2022). For decades, the language and cultural maintenance of various immigrant groups have been under investigation by many scholars, not only in linguistics but also in history, sociology, anthropology, and many other disciplines. This work has amassed a large body of immigrant language data, that provides information about how Australia’s immigration history has contributed to the country today.

NewsThe next phaseThe initial round of funding from ARDC for LDaCA and ATAP ended in June. ARDC have submitted a Research Infrastructure Investment Plan (otherwise known as the RIIP) covering the period through to 2028, but further funding for LDaCA has been approved for the coming financial year through to end of June 2024 while we await the outcome of the RIIP2023 application. LDaCA Director Prof Michael Haugh. Image ARDC/Marc Grimwade In the coming year, LDaCA will build on the work accomplished in the last two years while also developing some new areas of work. These will include building capabilities in repurposing data, particularly for community research platforms, and in collecting and organising data, particularly for donated social media data. ATAP will also continue to receive funding support within the broader LDaCA program. Language materials at Batchelor College, NT. Image: Ben Foley Community Connect project LDaCA has recently been successful in gaining funding under ARDC’s Community Connect program which aims to make data more accessible to communities (researchers or others). Through a co-design process in the second part of this year (2023), we will develop a training workshop and associated materials to provide Indigenous language workers and community members with the knowledge and skills to use our data portal effectively and to find the data in which they are interested. The co-design process will involve the participants in the University of Queensland’s Winter Language Revitalisation Intensive Workshop as well as discussion sessions at both the Australian Languages Workshop (July 21-23) and the Puliima Conference (August 21-25) where our team members, led by Robert McLellan, will explore ways of breaking down the jargon which is comfortable for academics but which can be a barrier for others. On the basis of the knowledge gained in these activities, the team will then develop the workshop and training materials. Initial delivery of a workshop will occur in November.   The Language Revitalisation program at UQ involves Samantha Disbray, Des Crump and Robert McLellan (also LDaCA’s Program Manager). On the LDaCA side, our Engagement lead, Simon Musgrave, will coordinate the project, and we are delighted that Otis Carmichael (our logo designer) will join the team.

We would like to thank Chief Investigator Louisa Willoughby for first letting us know about Kalin’s work, and Kalin for graciously agreeing to the interview and providing his thoughts. Kalin Stefanov, Monash University Image Source: Kalin Stefanov How did you get interested in sign language? During my PhD at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, I worked on a project that aimed at creating a learning environment where children can learn signs in a game-like setting. An on-screen avatar presents the signs and gives the child certain tasks to accomplish, and in doing so, the child gets to practise the signs. The system was thus required to interpret the signs produced by the child, distinguish them from other signs, and indicate whether or not it was the right one. For this project, I developed a real-time hand gesture recognition technology applied to the recognition of Swedish Sign Language signs. To date, this is the only real-time Swedish Sign Language recogniser and one of the few such technologies in the world (both in academia and industry). The project involved close collaboration with researchers (native signers) at the Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University and technology evaluation with the target end-users. This was my (immersed) introduction to the fascinating world of sign language communication and since then I have participated in a range of research projects related to different sign language technologies. Can you tell us about the project you are currently undertaking? My current project addresses the computational modelling of Auslan. The project expects to generate knowledge by creating the largest Auslan dataset, enabling further advancements in this research area. The dataset will also play an essential role in other research fields, e.g. sign linguistics. Expected outcomes include the invention of the first Auslan recogniser and generator, representing a substantial advancement towards fully automated Auslan translation. The Auslan recogniser will be able to distinguish 1000+ isolated Auslan signs. This means that by providing a video of an isolated Auslan sign, the recogniser will ‘translate’ it to written or spoken English. We also aim to provide mechanisms for personalisation of the recogniser to account for individual variations in signing. The Auslan generator will operate in the reverse direction and be able to synthesise 1000+ isolated Auslan signs. This means that by providing a written or spoken English word, the generator will ‘translate’ it to a video of an isolated Auslan sign. We also aim to provide mechanisms for the personalisation of the generator to account for individual preferences in appearance and signing style. Who will be helped by the output of your project, and how? The Auslan recogniser and generator will be general enough to form the core of many applications targeted at specific needs. I see at least two contexts that could benefit directly from the project outcomes: Auslan education and research. In education, on the one hand, I can envision an application for individual Auslan sign acquisition and training (think ‘Duolingo for Auslan’). On the other hand, in collaboration with A/Prof Louisa Willoughby and her extensive network, we will attempt to co-design more focused pedagogical applications of the technologies. We are still in the early stages of the technology development, hence we have not yet finalised what this could look like. One possible direction is to embed the developed technologies in education offerings for future Auslan interpreters. This will potentially improve the quality of Auslan training and ensure that more students pass interpreting exams and enter the workforce as confident Auslan interpreters.

During my time at Appen, a significant part of my work involved a diverse range of projects for both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, including phonetic transcription, grapheme-to-phoneme or letter-to-sound (L2S) rule development, and part-of-speech (POS) annotation. To break down these language technologies further, ASR enables computers to process human spoken language into readable text, allowing users to operate devices through speech or facilitate translation of that speech into other languages. Conversely, TTS generates an audio version of a written text. TTS can be used to improve accessibility, particularly for those with vision impairments or learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Language technology relies heavily on good-quality data, and the table below illustrates just some of the processes used in Appen projects, with use cases they can be applied to. Process Type Description Example Use Case Phonetic Transcription The process of transcribing words in a lexicon according to their sound (pronunciation lexicon), through the use of a phonetic alphabet such as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) or X-SAMPA (a phonetic script that uses symbols all found on a standard keyboard, aiding in native-speaker transcription). Suprasegmental features such as stress, tone, vowel length, pitch accent and syllabification can also be encoded where relevant to the language. Use in ASR: Appen developed language packs in 26 languages for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Babel program, facilitating improvement in speech recognition performance for languages other than English which have very little transcribed data. These projects generally have data collection, orthographic transcription and phonetic transcription components, the latter using X-SAMPA annotation. Further reading: IARPA - Babel Example dataset: IARPA Babel Mongolian Language Pack Use in TTS: In collaboration with health service providers GuildLink and MedAdvisor, Appen produces TTS audio of Australian Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) documents. This audio is available at medsinfo. Further reading: GuildLink Makes Consumer Medicines Information More Accessible Grapheme-to-Phoneme or Letter-to-Sound (L2S) Rule Development A set of rules for a given language that map between orthography and pronunciation, used to generate phonetic transcriptions from an input text. These rules can be both single and multi-letter mappings such as orthographic \u003cs\u003e → X-SAMPA /s/ and \u003csh\u003e → /S/ in English. The rules can refer to the surrounding environment which allows for alternative phonetic mappings based on the characters’ position in a word, surrounding morphemes, or other linguistic processes that impact pronunciation. For example, rules are implemented to specify when \u003cs\u003e should be pronounced as /z/ as in ‘roses’ or as /s/ as in ‘sit’. Suprasegmental features such as stress, tone, vowel length, pitch accent and syllabification may also be encoded, however, the accuracy of these in the output pronunciations depends on the given language and the extent to which these features are predictable from orthography alone. As was the case for the IARPA Babel program, one of the first steps in producing pronunciation lexicons involves running the wordlist through a language or dialect-specific L2S algorithm to generate hypothesised X-SAMPA pronunciations of each word. For many of the 26 languages in Babel, these rules didn’t yet exist and had to be developed through research, consultation and iterative testing with native speaker linguists. The automated output is then checked and edited as needed by native speaker linguists. L2S rules may be further developed according to customised requirements, for example, additiona","date":"2024-03-22","objectID":"/resources/general-resources/case-studies/data-mangement-appen/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Data Management in Language Technology: A Case Study of Appen","uri":"/resources/general-resources/case-studies/data-mangement-appen/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Data Management during the Life of a Project Due to the variety of services, data types and customisation capabilities provided by Appen, it is difficult to present a single standard approach to data management. Instead, I’ll focus on the processes that were developed for datasets that have both orthographic and phonetic transcription components, also known as transcription and lexicon multi-component projects. The basic procedure for these projects is outlined below: The client or project sponsor specifies the parameters for the dataset and its collection in consultation with Appen specialists. Appen carries out data collection, usually in the form of conversational or scripted telephony, VoIP or microphone recordings with qualified participants from Appen’s crowd of more than a million. Conversational data refers to spontaneous or unscripted natural speech on a variety of topics either over the telephone or with both participants in the same room, while for scripted data, participants read and respond to a set text of prompts, curated to facilitate topic, domain, keywords, key phrases and phonetic coverage. All participants are provided with a consent form explaining the purpose of the collection and how the data will be used, and only take part in the collection if they are happy and comfortable to do so, and if they sign the consent form. Personal data such as names are anonymised and sensitive personal data is not collected. The audio data is then quality-checked to ensure it meets the requirements for the collection, including demographic balance, language and content, background noise levels, audio levels and recording duration. The approved audio goes through some pre-processing steps to batch the data into smaller segments, then is orthographically transcribed by the transcription (TX) team. Timestamps are checked at this stage as well to ensure correct alignment of the audio and the transcribed text, and a variety of labels are added to capture speaker and non-speaker noise events (e.g. laugh, cough, background noise). Rigorous quality assurance processes are applied while the transcription is ongoing and on the resulting complete data set. Figure 1: Example of audio with transcription, batched and presented to transcribers in tool. Image Source: Appen Figure 2: Example of the resulting transcription text file. Image Source: Appen A sorted list of unique word forms (e.g. ‘house’, ‘houses’) occurring in the dataset is created from the orthographically transcribed data and sent to the lexicon (LX) team, who work with a group of native speaker linguists to prepare phonetic transcriptions of the words, either in X-SAMPA or another phonetic script. If a POS lexicon is also required for the dataset, this is similarly created from the sorted list of unique word forms and checked by native speaker linguists. Figure 3: Example of a Hungarian pronunciation lexicon loaded to the transcription tool for native speaker review. Image Source: Appen Figure 4: Example of a UK English pronunciation lexicon. Image Source: Appen Figure 5: Example of a UK English POS lexicon. Image Source: Appen Data across each stage is validated for quality assurance. The audio, transcription and lexicon(s) are packaged for delivery. As shown above, the data for a single project goes through multiple stages of annotation and requires specialist linguist expertise in the data management process before each part can be combined for final delivery. One major challenge in this process is dealing with errors and inconsistencies that arise both prior to, and during, the validation stage, particularly where data is shared between the TX and LX teams.

Additional details appear in a pop-up window when you click on the “tile” for a given dataset.

More detailed metadata for each dataset is tracked internally and this is used to further assist with client queries and requests. Some of the additional metadata categories recorded include the demographics of the contributors for each dataset, such as the age range and gender distribution of the participants, the dialect coverage within a specific language, the year of collection, and the domains or topics discussed in the collection. Using the metadata as filters, requests can be divided into three alternative outcomes: Dataset(s) matching all requirements are available and a sample of the data is shared with the client to confirm this is the case. Dataset(s) matching only some of the requirements are available and samples of these are shared in case they are still applicable to the project. No dataset matching the requirements is available and a quote is then prepared for producing a new dataset ​​or enhancing an existing dataset. In terms of dataset storage, collections are catalogued first according to language and second by dataset type. This method works particularly well for pre-labeled datasets, because, if nothing else, clients usually know which language(s) they want data for and other specifics can follow from there.

Two main issues that are important to consider for data collections are: Ensuring that collections with multiple component parts are organised in such a way that updates can be applied to the whole, rather than introducing inconsistencies between related data. Determining the parties that will be using the repository and assuring that the methods of accessing data are intuitive for all groups. These issues are handled in the Appen workflow through the use of iterative semi-automated spelling checks and other similar processes which enable modifications to be integrated into all levels of the dataset, and through clear recording and accessibility of the metadata describing a collection, available both to Appen staff and its clients. For LDaCA, these issues are of equal importance for wider data management. To the first point, while it is ultimately the responsibility and prerogative of the data contributor to decide how their data should be organised, LDaCA can also assist with this process. Guidance is available on best practices for data management and organisation of metadata, both in the form of the documentation available at LDaCA Resources, as well as automated validation of metadata category requirements for datasets added and edited through Crate-O. To the second point, LDaCA has a responsibility to ensure that tools to facilitate data management and discoverability are accessible and intuitive for all, including the portals that use the Oni application to access data packaged as RO-Crates. This should be an iterative process, with further improvements to operability implemented based on user feedback and needs.

Important aims and motivations of the LDaCA project are to secure language data in Australia and to make it easily available to researchers (and other interested parties). But language researchers have been aware of these issues for some time and the AusNC was an earlier attempt to address them. The AusNC was discussed in various places before the work of assembling data began. A meeting of interested people was held at the conferences of the Australian Linguistic Society and the Applied Linguistics Association of Australia in 2008, and a workshop was held in 2008 (proceedings published in Haugh et al. 2009), supported by an ARC-funded network for research into speech and communication (HSC-Net). Following these meetings, funding support from the Australian National Data Service, and subsequent funding and technical support from Griffith University enabled us to start the AusNC project, which was led by Michael Haugh, then a staff member at Griffith. Several data sets, which already existed and could easily be accessed, were included in this initial stage of the project: AustLit (selected samples of out-of-copyright poetry, fiction and criticism ranging from 1795 to the 1930s) The Australian Corpus of English (ACE) The Australian component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-AUS) Australian Radio Talkback (ART) The Corpus of Oz Early English (COOEE) The Monash Corpus of English (MCE) The Griffith Corpus of Spoken Australian English (GCSAusE) Braided Channels (oral histories of women from the Channel Country) Mitchell and Delbridge (a sample from data collected around 1960 documenting the speech of Australian adolescents) The team behind the AusNC always hoped that additional data would be added to the corpus, although funding constraints meant that only one further collection, the La Trobe Corpus of Spoken English, was added to the corpus shortly after the initial launch of the AusNC web interface. The Griffith University eResearch Services built the web interface and hosted the data for the AusNC, which was launched in 2012. From 2014, the Alveo virtual laboratory also held a copy of the data and provided alternative ways of interacting with it. However, after the launch of the Alveo version, the Griffith version of the corpus changed in various ways, and the two versions remained out of sync for a time, before both eventually became inaccessible when changes in the underlying technologies meant that maintaining those digital infrastructures was no longer cost effective. The Alveo virtual laboratory still exists, in principle, but has not been regularly maintained since 2019, and its services are rarely operational. With no ongoing funding and no staff member affiliated with the AusNC project, Griffith University indicated that it could not maintain the AusNC data sets and interface, and closed those facilities when the data was transferred to LDaCA in 2023.1 All the original data sets are now available (or are in the process of being made available) through the LDaCA data portal, and in one case, there is a substantial increase in the amount of data available (see discussion of Mitchell and Delbridge below).

An example of such a corpus in the AusNC is the Mitchell and Delbridge dataset. Mitchell and Delbridge wanted to know what Australian speech sounded like, how it differed from other varieties of English (often Received Pronunciation), and what sort of variation occurred within the Australian community. To answer these questions, Mitchell and Delbridge recruited school principals across the country to organise recordings of adolescents reading word lists and other prepared material, with a small, less structured component. As mentioned above, the AusNC made only a small part of this dataset available. LDaCA is delighted that, with the assistance of the University of Sydney, we are now able to provide access to data from all of the 7,736 speakers from 330 schools who were recorded. Another example of such a corpus in the AusNC is the Braided Channels collection, which contains 70 hours of oral history interviews with women from Queensland’s Channel Country. This is an example of a collection that was created to answer historical and cultural questions, but has been repurposed to enable researchers to address linguistic questions as well.

The kinds of material and the relative amounts of different kinds of material are decided in advance, and then data is collected accordingly. We can distinguish two sub-types within this category: the plan already exists or the plan needs to be developed independently. Existing plan In some cases, data is collected according to the plan of another corpus which already exists, so that meaningful comparisons can be made. An example of this approach in the AusNC is the Australian Corpus of English (ACE), which was designed to be comparable with two previous corpora: the Brown Corpus of American English and the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus of UK English (which was itself designed to be comparable with the Brown Corpus). The Australian component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-AUS) is another example of this type of corpus in the AusNC. Independent plan Alternatively, a corpus can be designed independently, but with the intention that it should be representative of some realm of language use, showing different genres and registers, and possibly also sampling some aspects of demographic variation. A classic example of such a corpus is the British National Corpus (BNC: 1994 version, 2014 version), which includes samples of both written and spoken language, with different kinds of written text in specified proportions, and which samples speaker variation across dimensions such as geography, gender and age. The BNC is sometimes referred to as a ‘reference corpus’; the idea is that it provides a baseline against which phenomena from other datasets can be compared. COOEE was constructed on similar, if less ambitious, lines. The corpus is divided into four time periods, with an approximately equal amount of material in each. Texts are assigned to one of four different types, and the proportion of each of those types is approximately equal in each time period. Such a design makes it easy to examine chronological change or variation between registers.

Again, we can distinguish some sub-types here. Restricted amount of data Sometimes, opportunistic data collection is the only viable strategy. An example of this is the approach often taken by linguists documenting languages whose future is uncertain. In that situation, carefully planning what kinds of data to collect and in what proportions would be ideal, but is typically a luxury which cannot be afforded. Collecting anything which is easily available is at least a good starting point — if one becomes aware that there are large gaps in the data collected, one can try to address the problem in the future, but that may not ever be possible. This type of corpus is the result of making the best one can of limited opportunities, which restrict the amount of data which is available. Collections of spoken interaction are often assembled in this way. The Griffith Corpus of Spoken Australian English (GCSAusE), which includes recordings made and transcribed by students, is an example of this type of corpus in the AusNC. Extensive data Opportunistic data collection is also relevant to big data: many researchers work with data from the web nowadays, and this almost inevitably involves opportunistic procedures. However, in this case, the large amount of data which is accessible can justify a claim that a significant part of the variation occurring in language use (at least for a certain type of use) will be represented in the data. On this basis, many linguists are happy to use a corpus of web data, at least for exploratory research. Figure 2: The Australian National Corpus logo. Image Source: LDaCA ","date":"2024-03-22","objectID":"/news/posts/ausnc/:2:3","tags":null,"title":"What happened to the Australian National Corpus (AusNC)?","uri":"/news/posts/ausnc/"},{"categories":null,"content":"AusNC as an opportunistic collection We have set out three broad strategies above for constructing a corpus. The AusNC calls itself a corpus, so can we assign it to one of these types? We hope that the answer to this question is clear: the AusNC was an opportunistic collection. When the possibility of a corpus was being discussed, there were proposals for it to be carefully planned. For example, in a paper published following one of the workshops leading up to the AusNC, Pho (2009) argued that an Australian corpus should mirror the design of the BNC. However, even putting together a collection of written material on the scale of the BNC is a huge task, never mind the spoken language component; the BNC itself was produced by a large team working over a number of years. The AusNC project never enjoyed a level of funding which would have made such a plan possible (indeed, the amount of funding we received while very welcome was modest). In these circumstances, we had no alternative but to create the AusNC from existing data sources which custodians were prepared to share. We did hope that this model would make it easy to expand the corpus, but this did not occur, as we were not able to develop the infrastructure necessary for ongoing expansion of the corpus with the limited amount of funding we had. In 2012, it seemed obvious that the appropriate term for our project was corpus. We were putting together a collection of language data and it came to exist as an entity in its own right. What was included might be the result of rather random factors, but there was a coherence in that all the data related to language use, in fact, use of the English language in Australia. No one was talking about ‘data commons’2 when the AusNC was created (or we were not listening). If the concept had been actively discussed, perhaps we would have described what we were doing as a data commons. The inception of LDaCA coincided, more or less, with the two factors mentioned above which led to the AusNC becoming non-viable: the understandable withdrawal of support from Griffith University and the instability of the Alveo infrastructure due to funding constraints. It was therefore inevitable that transferring the AusNC collection to the new project would be an early priority. Approaching this task, we faced the problem of whether it still made sense to refer to the collection of datasets as the AusNC. After discussion within our project, and with the custodians of the AusNC datasets, we decided that retaining the name would suggest a coherence which did not exist now that the AusNC was part of LDaCA. The AusNC is now part of a larger assemblage of collections of data, and we felt that any internal coherence which the AusNC might have did not differentiate it, or the datasets it was composed of, from that broader landscape. Therefore, we made the decision to include the component datasets of the AusNC as separate collections in LDaCA data portal. The top-level description of each of the collections contains the following sentence to acknowledge the history of the data: “This collection was previously accessible online via the Australian National Corpus (AusNC), an initiative managed by Griffith University between 2012 and 2023.” Additionally, this blog post is available to those who are interested in the history of the AusNC.3 The corpus is dead, long live the data commons!

The program has run in some years since then, hosted by the RCC (2019) and also by the UQ Graduate School (2020). In 2023, the program ran again, this time under the auspices of the Australian Text Analytics Program (ATAP). Two UQ staff members, Sam Hames (Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Computational Humanities) and Simon Musgrave (Engagement Lead for ATAP and for the Language Data Commons of Australia) led the program, and four students participated. The program supports research students to explore the possibilities of digital scholarship, particularly in HASS. Our Fellows are students undertaking extended research projects who spent 12-15 weeks learning about digital and computational skills in order to enhance their current research/thesis topic or to work on an independent digital project. They explored digital research methods in areas including Computational analysis of text Creation of new software tools to support their specific research area Social media analytics Assessment and analysis of digital environments including mobile apps Online games as social and cultural objects The Fellows met regularly in activities to develop a sound understanding of digital research methods and tools, including seminars, reading groups, and training workshops. They also had access to mentors who advised and collaborated on their digital projects. The four Fellows who participated in the 2023 program and their projects were: Evelyn (Eve) Ansell (UQ, Linguistics): Eve works in the field of Conversation Analysis which uses very detailed transcriptions of spoken interactions as data. The detail means the basic word forms involved are not easy to identify. For example, dea:::l indicates the word deal with emphasis (the underlining) and a greatly lengthened vowel sound (the colons). Clearly, the search function in a word processor is not going to find this as an instance of the word deal! Eve’s project looked at the possibility of developing code in a Jupyter notebook which could identify base word forms in such transcriptions and allow the researcher to see all instances of a word in an interaction. Eve also had the opportunity to work on the problem as part of an industry placement with AARNet. In Eve’s words: My only regret is that I didn’t do the GDRF sooner. This sort of learning should be required early on in all Humanities research training programs. I cannot speak highly enough of Simon and Sam. They enthusiastically share their domains of knowledge, but also engage with us about our own work. To have access to experts willing to talk through current projects, future scoping, frustrations, and wild ideas is incredibly valuable. It’s easy to forget how much of our research work happens in the digital space. It’s not just the data, it’s how we interface with it. The GDRF taught me to think differently about how I treat my research workflow at almost every point.

For my postgraduate research, I documented and described grammatical topics of Sudest (known as Vanga Vanatɨna by its speakers), an Oceanic language spoken in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The language is spoken on the islands of Vanatinai (also known as Sudest and Tagula) and Yeina in the Louisiade Archipelago, approximately 350 kilometres southeast of the PNG mainland. In the following, I discuss decisions I made and processes I followed related to the collection of language data and archiving the resulting corpus of texts, including ethical considerations, ownership of the data, data formats, metadata, and data security and reuse. This is by no means meant as a guide (of best practice) for projects where language data are being collected with speakers of un(der)described languages. Rather, it is an account of some of the types of considerations and procedures that need to be considered when collecting language data and how I handled them in this instance. Map of Louisiade Archipelago Image Source: Harriet Sheppard Before recording with a speaker for the first time, I would explain the project to the speaker and their rights as contributors to the project. I would explain how I would use the language recordings, how they would be stored and accessed and how speakers of the language or other researchers might access and use the recordings in the future. This included discussing how they, the person(s) making the recording, would retain ownership over the recording (i.e., intellectual and cultural property rights). They would also be the ones to choose access rights over the text and have the option to withdraw any or all recordings they made from the corpus at any point (more on these below). After these discussions, if the speaker was still interested in the project, I would then record an oral consent form with them. The consent form was in English, the language of wider communication in the province. In cases where the speaker didn’t speak or spoke limited English, we would have a translator present for this process. I chose to use an oral consent form as it is accessible to all participants no matter their literacy levels. It also has the advantage of being a more durable format compared with a paper consent form, particularly when working in a hot and humid climate and it can also be easily backed up. Transcription session with Abel Sam Image Source: Harriet Sheppard Each time I made a recording with a speaker or speakers, I played the recording back to them to check that they were happy with the recording and so that they could decide on what sort of access conditions they wanted the archived recording to have. If the speaker was not satisfied with the recording, sometimes they would choose to make another recording and delete the original or simply delete the recording and maybe try again later. If they were happy with the recording, they would decide on the access conditions they wanted for the archived recording. The possibilities ranged from the most restricted, being that only I, as the original researcher, could access the recordings and use them for my research, to the opposite end of the access continuum where anyone interested could download and listen to the recordings, read any transcriptions, and potentially use them for educational or research purposes. In between these two ends of the continuum, they could opt for other access conditions such as only allowing access for registered users of the archive, or only for researchers and speakers, or just for speakers. They could also choose to have a text embargoed for a certain period of time.

In order to study language change in real-time, the project also incorporates legacy data from two sources: a sociolinguistic project carried out in the late 1970s and an oral history collection created during the 1980s. Altogether, the birth years of the participants span over a century, from the 1890s to the 1990s, and five age groups are represented, as captured in Figure 1.

Below, we present each sub-corpus individually, and provide a summary of each sub-corpus. We describe the ways in which recordings were made and transcription was managed; outline how we were able to get comparable demographic information from participants when this was not standardised across the corpora; and detail how we dealt with participant consent and privacy. We close by reviewing a set of data access concerns around de-identification, data security and access and re-use. In this overview of the process by which different datasets collected for distinct purposes and under varying conditions have been brought together to constitute a coherent corpus of language data, we hope to highlight some of the considerations key to working with sociolinguistic data, and the enormous potential for the incorporation of other data sources through the use of appropriate standards for data management.

Data collection is still ongoing, but as of June 2023, Sydney Speaks 2010s comprises 142 sociolinguistic interviews with men and women of varying ages from different ethnic communities in Sydney representing some of the largest ethnic minorities in Australia, namely Anglo-Celtic, Chinese, Greek, and Italian Australians. The interviews were generally conducted individually (though some were done in pairs), and they were conducted by community members, typically with people they knew. The data is highly interactional, in some cases conversational, and topics vary greatly across recordings, as the interviewers followed the participants’ lead in choosing topics. There is a focus on recording narratives of personal experience, as these have been demonstrated to be particularly ideal for recording the everyday vernacular (Labov 1984:32-42). Recordings and transcripts Interviews are recorded using a Zoom H4N digital recording device in WAV format at 44.1 kHz/16 bits. They are orthographically transcribed, aligned at the utterance level and then uploaded into LaBB-CAT (Language, Brain and Behaviour Corpus Analysis Tool (Fromont \u0026 Hay 2012)), for forced alignment (which automates the process for alignment at the level of the phoneme). LaBB-CAT also serves as the corpus management tool, where the corpus is stored, data is further annotated, and concordance searches can be conducted. LaBB-CAT does not include corpus analysis tools as such, but data can be downloaded in multiple formats to allow for analyses, including CSV and WAV, as well as in formats that are compatible with tools that are used widely by linguists, such as Elan, illustrated in Figure 2 (Lausberg \u0026 Sloetjes 2009) and Praat in Figure 3 (Boersma \u0026 Weenink 2019).

This questionnaire is conducted orally at the end of the interview (as a continuation of the interview), and the participants’ responses are filled in by the interviewer. Information is extracted from the written form, validated in the recorded audio, and added to a metadata spreadsheet in Excel. We use customised metadata, rather than drawing on a standard metadata vocabulary; however the demographic information from each sub-corpus is standardised in Excel and comparable across the three sub-corpora.

Variation in Australian English: The sociolects of Sydney. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press Sub corpus overview The Sydney Social Dialect Survey (SSDS) is a collection of 177 sociolinguistic interviews with adult and teenage Australians from Anglo-Celtic, Greek, and Italian backgrounds, recorded in Sydney between 1977 and 1980, as part of an ARC-funded project led by Barbara Horvath, of the Department of Linguistics at the University of Sydney. For the Sydney Speaks project, recordings from Anglo-Celtic adults (born in the 1930s) and from Anglo-Celtic, Greek and Italian Teenagers (born in the 1960s) were included. The recordings with Greek and Italian adults were set aside, as they arrived in Australia as adults and speak English as a second language, and thus raise a different set of questions for the study of language variation and change. There were 7 participants who did not meet the Sydney Speaks participant criteria (e.g., one of their parents was not of the target ethnic groups), leaving a total of 20 adults and 72 teenagers for inclusion. Like the contemporary linguistic data, the Sydney Social Dialect Survey comprises sociolinguistic interviews, but these are more interview-like: the interviewers were not community members, and they did not typically know the participants; and the topics were more defined (some common topics being games, layout of the school, nicknames, and language). Recordings and transcripts Interviews were conducted in the 1970s with a cassette recorder and made available to the Sydney Speaks project directly by the lead researcher. The audio cassettes, type-written transcripts, and demographic information of the participants were stored in boxes in Horvath’s garage in Sydney and passed on to Catherine Travis in 2013. The cassettes (pictured in Figure 6) were digitised using PARADISEC equipment in the College of Asia Pacific Studies at the ANU to create WAV files (96.1 kHz, resampled using Audacity into smaller files of 44.1 kHz). Fortuitously, the cassettes had been preserved very well, and nearly all of them (124/130) were able to be digitised, and with further refinement, it was possible to conduct acoustic analyses (though in some cases, this presented considerable challenges that did not arise with the new recordings). The typewritten transcripts were scanned and digitised as PDFs, but it was not possible to convert them into machine-readable transcripts, partly because they had been marked up by hand for transcript corrections, coding and annotation, as can be seen in the sample in Figure 7. They were therefore re-transcribed in Elan by the Sydney Speaks team, following the protocols applied for the contemporary data (see sample Elan rendition of part of Figure 7 in Figure 8).

Details were standardised and added to the project metadata database in an Excel spreadsheet. Further demographic information was added from several other sources, including participant overview documents put together by the lead researcher, original cassette labels as well as from the audio recordings themselves. We were not able to extract the same demographic information for all participants, and we have more details for some than for others, something which needs to be taken into account in cross-corpus comparisons.

NSW Bicentennial oral history collection. Council on the Ageing NSW Branch and NSW Oral History Association of Australia, housed at the National Library of Australia. The process of conducting oral history involves recording interviews to collect information about the past, from the perspective of those who lived through relevant events. In recording everyday voices, oral histories are particularly valuable for research across Humanities disciplines as they capture the ‘little-heard voices of society’. They are of particular value for linguistic analysis, because they aim to ensure that ‘the historical record includes different languages and vernacular speech, accent and dialect’ (Oral History Statement of value; What is oral history? Retrieved May 23, 2022, from Oral History Australia). Like the sociolinguistic interview, oral histories elicit narratives of personal experience, and thus they provide highly comparable data. Sub corpus overview The NSW Bicentennial Oral History Collection, produced by the NSW Bicentennial Oral History Project, comprises 200 interviews recorded in 1987 and 1988 with men and women born before 1910. The Sydney Speaks project has incorporated 31 interviews with people who were born in Sydney and whose parents were also born in Sydney. The recordings include discussions about life in Sydney in the early part of the twentieth century, including the war, women’s first experience in the workforce, the outbreak of the Spanish flu, and so on. The collection is managed by the State Library of NSW and the National Library of Australia. In 2017, the Sydney Speaks project gained access to the collection via direct request to the National Library of Australia. Recordings and transcripts The original audio of each interview was recorded on cassette tape and was made available to the Sydney Speaks team in MP3 and WAV format, allowing for acoustic analysis. Type-written transcripts (Figure 10) were also made available, from which the Sydney Speaks team was able to create machine-readable versions via OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The original transcript captured the content very accurately, and this was imported into Elan and edited to produce detailed transcriptions that are aligned with the audio and facilitate linguistic analysis (Figure 11).

The recordings themselves also provided a wealth of demographic information, as is common practice in oral histories, meaning that full demographic profiles could be developed for most participants. Some investment is necessary to capture and systematize this information, but its availability is one of the clear advantages they have for (socio)linguistic analysis.

For the audio, we identify the segment that needs de-identification, and run a low-pass filter using a Praat script so that the name is not recognisable. During an interview, some participants have requested that a section not be included in the study, generally due to what they perceive to be the sensitive nature of a certain topic (for example, one participant talking about banking in Hong Kong).

Identifying Codes for Languages One very important piece of metadata for language data is a description of the language or languages that the data represent. This is not a simple problem because the relationship between languages and names for them is not one-to-one. Some languages have more than one name: for example, Farsi and Persian can both be used to refer to the same language. Some names refer to more than one language: for example, there are languages called Buru used in Nigeria and in Indonesia. To avoid the confusion that can arise from such situations, various systems have been developed to assign unique identifiers to languages.

When considering how data can be shared and accessed by others, it is important to consider these legal constraints. Copyright protects expressions of ideas in works such as books, music, paintings, films, and performative acts such as speech, sign and gesture, etc., and therefore also data collections. The creator of the work is known as the copyright owner. Copyright provides two types of rights: Economic rights: The owner has the exclusive right to reproduce, publish, perform, communicate, and adapt or modify their work, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. This right can be transferred or shared with others via assignment or licensing. Moral rights: The work must be correctly attributed and not treated in a derogatory manner. This protects the integrity of the work. Moral rights cannot be transferred or shared. Questions for reflection: How can I identify the copyright owner of a language collection? Unlike trademarks and patents, copyright doesn’t require registration and there are no official records that can be searched to identify a copyright owner in Australia. Additionally, the creator of material is not necessarily the copyright owner and copyright may also be jointly owned. Copyright ownership is determined according to a set of complex rules set out in the Copyright Act and its amendments. It is important to review in detail the law to ensure the correct owner has been identified. Legal advice should be sought where the copyright owner cannot be clearly identified. If the copyright owner has died the copyright is usually passed on to that person’s spouse or children. (See more information at the end of this section.) The copyright owner of a language collection can be identified by considering the following questions: Question Further Information Does the collection comprise materials all collected under the same conditions? (e.g., as part of the same research project)YesNo If the collection includes material from a third party, the copyright owner and copyright status should be identified for each subset of the collection. Has the copyright owner been determined by a contract, formal agreement, or other relevant document?YesNo In some cases, existing contracts or agreements will assign copyright ownership in advance. This will take precedence over the rules set out in the Copyright Act. What type of material is included in the collection?Textual workMusical workDramatic workComputer programArtistic workFilm or videoSound recordings Generally, the author of a textual work, musical work, dramatic work, computer program or artistic work (i.e., the person who created the work) is the first owner of copyright. However, the general rules for films, videos and sound recordings are different.For sound recordings, copyright is owned by the ‘maker’ of the sound recording, typically the person or company who owns the recording equipment.For film and video, copyright is owned by the person or company which made the arrangements for the creation of the work.In the academic context, this is typically the university where the research was conducted. Was the material created by an employee in the course of their employment?YesNo When the work was created by an employee as part of their usual work duties, the employer is the copyright owner (unless there is a specific employment agreement that specifies otherwise). Is the work a performance?YesNo Performers’ rights apply to live performances including dramatic works, musical works, dances, circus acts, expressions of folklore, readings, and recitations of existing or improved literary works recorded or filmed with or without an audience. Permission must be sought to record the live performance, and to broadcast and distribute recordings.As of 1 January ","date":"2023-10-18","objectID":"/resources/ldaca-resources/guidance-for-data-governance-decisions/:2:1","tags":null,"title":"Guidance for Data Governance Decisions","uri":"/resources/ldaca-resources/guidance-for-data-governance-decisions/"},{"categories":null,"content":"1.2 Licensing Documenting access conditions is key to ensuring appropriate use of the data over time. Transparency and clarity surrounding access conditions also supports the sustainability of the data and reduces the need for the Data Steward to be available to communicate or enforce the access conditions. While aaccess conditions can be documented internally in a data management plan, a common and useful mechanism for documenting and managing access is via licensing. Licensing allows the copyright owner to share the right to access and use the data without forfeiting or transferring the ownership of the copyright of the work. The license sets out the conditions for who can access the data, how it can be used, and what other conditions are required. While licensing is a legal mechanism, it can also be used to uphold other conditions as determined by the Data Steward. Questions for reflection: Is there an existing data license? Question Further Information Is there an existing license outlining the access conditions?YesNo If the collection has already been made available, a license may have already been prepared. Avoid duplicating previous work by checking this first. Although it is best practice to have a single license attached to a collection, multiple licenses can exist as long as they are non-exclusive.

Is the licensee required to pay a fee? How is the fee processed? Under what conditions can the license be terminated? How will disputes be resolved? While in some cases it may be necessary to write a custom data license, for other collections it may be possible to apply an already-existing license, such as a Creative Commons license. Creative Commons provides a useful option for promoting data reusability while protecting key access conditions.

Persistent Identifiers Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are digital identifiers that are permanently assigned to physical and digital objects. In contrast to other identifiers that are used online, such as URLs, PIDs are persistent, meaning they point to reliable information in the long term. They have become crucial for research data as they make a collection citable; ensure that it is findable even if moved to a different location; and establish its relationship to other objects and entities in the academic research environment (e.g. researchers, funders, organisations, academic publications, software and other datasets). While various PID systems have been in use for research data over the last 25 years, including ISBN and ORCiD, the DOI System has been the most widely used globally to date and is becoming the default identifier for research datasets. A DOI is a unique number made up of a prefix and a suffix separated by a forward slash. It is resolvable by displaying it as a link: https://doi.org/10.1000/182. An example of a DOI for a data collection (obtained via the university library) can be viewed here: Sydney Speaks DOI landing page. Questions for reflection: Who can get a DOI? How? Question Further Information Does the collection have an existing PID?YesNo Investigate whether the collection already has an existing PID as this is sometimes automatically generated when the collection is listed or archived with an archive or library. Who can generate a DOI for the collection? The most common DOI minting services are universities, research organisations, research libraries and research repositories. You can make enquiries with your university library or the research repository of the organisation that supported the data collection.

Metadata Metadata is data about data — information that describes the data collection as a whole; provides the context and conditions under which the data was collected, can be stored, shared and used; and the characteristics of the format, duration or size of data making up the collection; and includes socio-demographic details of participants. Standardised metadata allows data to be more easily found and understood, to be compared, and grouped with other similar objects. Metadata is often managed in two different ways: A standard metadata vocabulary (such as Dublin Core (DC), Darwin Core and Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS). These vocabularies set out a limited list of metadata terms that can be used across disciplines with the aim of promoting a shared metadata framework. A customised metadata strategy, unique to a particular project to meet specific needs. Where a customised metadata strategy is used, metadata terms should be clearly defined so as to facilitate comprehension of the metadata and to avoid misunderstandings or multiple interpretations. Customised metadata terms can be mapped onto existing vocabularies in order to organise metadata in a manner aligned to a standard. Questions for reflection: What does it mean to apply standards to metadata? Question Further Information Does the collection use metadata terms from an existing metadata vocabulary?YesNo If the collection uses customised metadata terms (i.e. not an existing metadata vocabulary), consider mapping the relationships between the custom system and an existing metadata vocabulary. This will facilitate findability as the metadata aligns with standards used in the research community.

CT: Our main goal at the Australian National University is to grow the set of collections that will be incorporated into LDaCA with a particular focus on Australian English and migrant languages. This involves identifying relevant collections, which is a bit of a ‘language dig’, as these are diverse, dispersed, and often quite hidden away. Many have restrictions around data sharing, so we work closely with data stewards to set up the appropriate access and licensing conditions. As well as this, we are developing tools that can enhance the usability of both legacy corpora and newer collections, including tools for aligning transcripts that exist in different formats with their corresponding audio, standardising orthography, streamlining the anonymisation process, and so on. Right now, most of what we know about Australian English comes from middle-class Australians of Anglo-Celtic background living in major urban centres. A better representation of Australian society in our language collections will broaden the scope of the research that can be done, allow new questions to be asked, and provide a better picture of Australia overall. NE: My role is to keep our foot on the gas for the huge job of getting a continued flow of new corpus data, as well as digitised legacy data, mostly for the languages of New Guinea and the Pacific. MB: I’m the Academic Lead for these projects at the University of Sydney. In this role, I manage the projects overall and work closely with staff from the Sydney Corpus Lab and the Sydney Informatics Hub. We develop text analytics tools and training for analysis of text/language, including but not limited to tools for linguistic and discourse analysis. A team at PARADISEC is also involved and contributes to work packages around language collections for Indigenous languages of Australia and the Pacific. My role as director of the Sydney Corpus Lab is crucial for these projects. The lab’s mission is to build research capacity in corpus linguistics at the University of Sydney, to connect Australian corpus linguists, and to promote the method in Australia, both in linguistics and in other disciplines. We organise relevant events on corpus linguistics and text analytics, including guest lectures and workshops, and create resources such as corpora, blog posts, video playlists, and curated introductions in different languages.

CT: There is a wide range of collections out there that represent an absolute treasure trove of knowledge not only for language in Australia, but also for Australian society, culture, and history. For example, oral histories or ethnographic interviews can provide invaluable linguistic data, and likewise, sociolinguistic interviews may contain invaluable information for historians, sociologists, or anthropologists. But because there is no way to know what collections exist, what is in them, and what is accessible, this treasure trove is underutilised. With many decades of data collection behind us and with recent technological developments, now is the perfect time to open this up to create a language data commons. It is exciting to think of the opportunities that this presents for us to cross disciplinary boundaries, and expand our understanding of Australia’s social, cultural, and linguistic history. NE: We all know that most of the world’s languages are under-resourced, lacking even a grammar or dictionary. A dream I have – which this project will move us very slightly toward – is that every one of the world’s 7,000 languages might one day have a vast library of corpus data, comparable to the 60 million words we have for Classical Greek, for example. Each language and culture deserves its own vast library wing. To give an idea of the scale of the challenge, so far in our part of the world there are only three languages (Bislama, Gurindji Kriol, and Ku Waru) where we have even one million words.

CT: Given the number of existing language collections, one piece of advice I would give to someone who wants to get started with data collection would be to learn what is already out there prior to beginning new data collection, and to think about how any new data you collect may contribute to existing collections or research projects, or alternatively, how existing collections might shape the kind of new data you might collect or the kind of research you might do. It is standard practice to contextualise the research that we do within the field; we are at a point where we should be doing the same with data collection. It is through our cumulative efforts, taking advantage of the work that has preceded us and building on that, that we will most advance in our scientific endeavours. NE: Find good ways of getting sensitive and accurate commentaries on the meaning of materials. We need the equivalent of Biblical or Talmudic commentaries for the digital age – metatexts that comment on what other texts mean. MB: Just give it a go and don’t be daunted! Go to workshops or summer schools, and avail yourself of other free or low-cost opportunities. Be (and remain) critical in your use of tools, and remember the value of your own knowledge and expertise. Discover the joy of mastering a new tool/technique or of knowing enough to find out that it is not for you or for your research project. If you find it useful, practice and also keep good notes so that you can return to the tool later and still know what to do. Always be transparent in how you use the tool/technique and make sure you know why you are using it.

If the collection does not have an existing persistent identifier, LDaCA recommends getting a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which is becoming the default identifier for research datasets. A DOI makes a collection citable; it ensures that it is findable even if moved to a different location; and it establishes its relationship to other objects and entities in the academic research environment (e.g. researchers, funders, organisations, academic publications, software and other datasets). See Obtaining a DOI for more information. Providing metadata that is organised with a consistent structure, and includes descriptors, definitions and contextual information where relevant. This includes metadata at the level of the collection (e.g. collection name, a narrative description of the corpus, the subject language(s), author(s) or Collector(s), publication year, access conditions, etc.), file (e.g. length in minutes, words) and participants (e.g. age, gender). LDaCA technologies enable programmatic detection, extraction and summarisation of existing metadata in a dataset; in order for this to work effectively, the metadata must be standardised. Metadata are mapped to open schemas including the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) vocabularies for describing language data and Schema.org for generic descriptions (e.g. Name, Identifier, Description). This approach allows many metadata terms to be linked to openly available and widely used definitions. Some metadata may be specific to a corpus or difficult to map to existing vocabulary terms. LDaCA makes use of the Language Data Ontology, which has been developed in consultation with OLAC and metadata specialists, to ensure consistency across terms. See Metadata for more information.

We will present a standards-based generalized architecture for large-scale data* repositories for research and preservation illustrated with real-world examples drawn from a number of languages and cultural archive projects. This work is taking place in the context of the Australian Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons, particularly the Language Data component thereof and the long-established PARADISEC cultural archive. The standards used include the Oxford Common File Layout for storage, Research Object CRATE (RO-Crate) for consistent linked-data description of FAIR digital objects, and a language data metadata profile to ensure long-term interoperability between systems and re-usability over time. We also discuss data licensing and authorization for access to non-open resources.

The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) and Indigenous Research Data Commons (HASS+I RDC). The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities. The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions. We would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands on which we live and work and the importance of Indigenous knowledge, culture and language to these projects. Peter Sefton lives and works on Wiradjuri land, and for Nick Thieberger and Simon Musgrave, it’s the land of the Kulin nation. PARADISEC is an online archive of cultural data which has been maintained for twenty years, in this presentation, we will look at some of the lessons learned from PARADISEC.

I am particularly focusing on the Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL) which is part of ATAP and represents an infrastructure for computational text analytics in the humanities. LADAL has an outreach component as it organizes webinars and workshops and it provides computational resources in the form of self-paced online tutorials as well as interactive notebooks that allow researchers to try out methods and apply them to their own data. I see my task as organizing and managing activities around LADAL by creating and optimizing resources as well as getting involved in outreach via events and building (inter-)national partnerships and collaborations with other computational humanities infrastructures. NT: I am in charge of work packages 1.1 and 1.2, Indigenous languages of Australia and the Pacific. I worked at AIATSIS in the past and set up an Aboriginal language centre in Port Hedland (Wangka Maya). I have worked in Vanuatu, and did my PhD research on Nafsan, a language from Efate, sparking an interest in languages of the Pacific. The work of recording speakers of Nafsan also resulted in a corpus of time-aligned text and media, as well as historical manuscripts that I have been finding in archives around the world. This led me to be concerned that existing records of these languages be made accessible to current speakers and so I helped establish the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC) which has many connections to cultural agencies in the Pacific. I currently lead a project (Nyingarn) to convert manuscripts in Australian Indigenous languages to text.

What excites you most about the projects? LW: That it is both building an exciting tool for researchers to better understand language variation AND making a resource that is useful for Auslan students and members of the community. MS: One of the most fulfilling aspects of my work is the opportunity to collaborate with researchers from diverse communities and fields or to see how resources I created help people from very different backgrounds in their work. I do take pride in inspiring and enabling researchers to explore the potential of computational methods, whether they are working on projects related to the language sciences, health sciences, social sciences, arts, or beyond. As a quantitative linguist who came to computation as a computerphobe philosopher, I really enjoy creating visualizations that communicate data and results and that provide an intuitive understanding of complex data sets. I also take pleasure in showing others how to perform statistical analyses that help them make informed decisions based on their findings. By optimizing workflows and automating procedures, I help researchers to work more efficiently and effectively, enabling them to achieve their goals more quickly and easily. Through my work, I aim to create an environment where researchers from diverse backgrounds and specializations can benefit from the potential of computational tools, regardless of their field of study or level of experience. I value the opportunity to work collaboratively with researchers to find solutions to complex problems, and to share my expertise with others to promote innovation and growth within the field. Overall, I believe that the application of computational methods is an exciting area of research that has the potential to transform the way we approach scientific inquiry in the humanities and social sciences. By helping researchers to explore the possibilities of these tools, I hope to contribute to a more vibrant and innovative research community. NT: Making textual material in these languages available so that speakers can find records in their own languages. Often there is very little available information for these languages, so every record becomes all the more important, especially in the context of colonial dispossession where the languages are no longer spoken everyday and there are efforts to relearn the language. It is exciting that this work can become part of a national commons, and be supported into the future, so that more and more material can be included. The simple task of locating a language record, digitising it, and making the files available with appropriate licenses means that it can be used by speakers, and by researchers for various new purposes.

What advice would you give someone who wants to get started with text analytics, corpus linguistics, or language data collection? LW: Jump in and start playing! There are lots of different tools and corpora online and I find it easiest to learn how to use them by just having a go and seeing what you can get out. It can be fun to look for little bits of variation or to see how common a certain word or phrase is, and doing something small will give you a sense of the kind of data you get out of the tools and how you might then incorporate them into a wider project. MS: If you’re just starting out with a new project, it’s essential to take it one step at a time. Start with a simple visualization or basic text processing task, such as concordancing, and build on it gradually. Don’t be intimidated by others who may have more experience or skills than you do. Instead, take the opportunity to learn from them and seek their guidance when necessary. It’s important to keep in mind that progress takes time, and comparing yourself to others can be discouraging. Instead, focus on comparing your current skills and accomplishments to your former self. Take pride in what you’ve created and the progress you’ve made. Celebrate your small wins and use them as motivation to keep moving forward. Another key to improving your skills is to seek feedback from others. Share your work with peers, mentors, or instructors who can provide constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or seek clarification when you’re unsure of something. Remember that learning is a continuous process, and even the most experienced professionals have room for growth and improvement. Embrace the journey, enjoy the learning process, and stay motivated by setting achievable goals for yourself. By doing so, you’ll be well on your way to developing your skills and achieving your goals. NT: The first steps in language data collection involve recording speakers, with all appropriate permissions in place, and with a consent form signed by them. Making those recordings as well as possible, following recommendations, doing training and so on, and managing the resulting files so they are not lost. Learn the basics of text querying, searching, and regular expressions. Be aware of the ethical considerations in using material from someone else’s language. But just start now!

But what does this include? We are aware of many data sources and, in the short term, the important questions are about priorities: What will be immediately useful? What data is stored precariously? What relationships can be leveraged? But in thinking for the long term, there is value in asking the question from a more conceptual point of view: What were the possibilities for making records of language use over our history and what has resulted (and not resulted) from those possibilities? I will try to at least start answering that question by providing a conceptual map of a metaphorical landscape and this will be structured around two themes: demography and technology. Demography is important because what languages were being used at any particular time depends on who was living in Australia at that time. On this dimension, the major point of articulation is the arrival of non-Indigenous people. The places of origin of those non-Indigenous people have changed over time, and that has had linguistic consequences, but not on the same scale as the initial change. Technology is important because the kinds of records which might exist of language use depend on the means which were available to make such records at a given time. And on this dimension, I think that there are three points of articulation that are important: the possibility of making written records, the possibility of recording sound and vision, and the possibility of digital records. Before European contact, Australia had a very diverse linguistic ecology. Credible estimates of the number of distinct languages range from around 250 up to as many as 490, with many more dialects. Contact between language groups was common and therefore multilingualism and multidialectalism were also common. We know that there was contact between Indigenous Australians and fishermen from the Indonesian archipelago (especially Makassarese people) from the evidence of loan words. But the only record which existed of this period in the linguistic history of the continent was what was passed from one generation to another by oral transmission. The presence of Europeans on the Australian continent brought a huge change to both dimensions of the map I am developing. Europeans landed on parts of Australia from some time in the 17th century, but I will take two dates in the 18th century to be crucial. Although earlier visitors may have recorded a few words which they heard from Indigenous Australians, written records of the languages only start properly (and even then to a limited extent) with Cook’s expedition in 1770, reflecting perhaps the scientific orientation of Joseph Banks. This is the first point of technological articulation in the language data landscape which introduced the possibility of making language records independent of human memory. And then from 1788, there has been a continuous non-Indigenous presence in Australia representing a huge demographic articulation point. During the 19th century (and into the 20th century), written records of Australian languages were produced by a variety of people such as explorers, missionaries, administrators (in fact, pretty much anyone who could be bothered). These records are scattered and new material continues to be found (for example, Des Crump’s ongoing work in the State Library of Queensland and the Queensland State Archives). If you would like to get a flavour of some records of this kind, the Nyingarn project is making many of them available online. (Nyingarn builds on earlier work which presented the Indigenous language materials collected by Daisy Bates as an online resource.) However, the efforts of these early recorders were sporadic, uncoordinated and poorly focused. In 1945, Sydney Baker wrote: “Records of their languages are extremely deficient for","date":"2022-12-07","objectID":"/news/posts/data-map/:0:0","tags":["Australia","language data"],"title":"Language data in Australia - Mapping a conceptual landscape","uri":"/news/posts/data-map/"},{"categories":["LDaCA"],"content":" PDF version By Peter Sefton, Nick Thieberger, Marco La Rosa, Simon Musgrave, River Tae Smith, Moises Sacal Bonequi – delivered by Peter Sefton at eResearch 2022 in Brisbane This work is licensed under CC BY 4.0. To view a copy of this license, visit http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This presentation will look at how a Metadata Standard - RO-Crate - with Metadata Profile (the Language Data Commons) is being developed and implemented. Two major collections are collaborating on the standard, PARADISEC and the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA). This ongoing standardisation effort for language data is designed to improve interoperability, reduce costs for data migration and allow storage on disk, object storage or in archival repositories. RO-Crate is a linked-data metadata system which allows discovery metadata (Who, what where) based on the widely adopted Schema.org vocabulary to be seamlessly integrated with more discipline-specific metadata. RO-Crate uses metadata profiles to provide guidance for packaging resources for particular disciplines and purposes. In this presentation, we will introduce a RO-Crate metadata profile for language data which extends the core RO-Crate standard with new vocabulary terms adapted from pre-linked-data discipline-specific metadata efforts, particularly the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) standards. The profile has English-language guidance on how to structure collections of resources in a repository with links between them, such that they can be indexed and displayed via APIs and search/browse portals. The profile is also implemented as a series of machine-readable profiles for the Describo Online metadata description system. We will demonstrate current ways of describing items in a variety of languages and modes (spoken, written and signed), from a large set of heterogeneous language resources held by PARADISEC and LDaCA. We will also show how to access them via API calls and a search portal, and how resources may be stored in simple storage systems using the Arkisto platform (a set of standards and principles).

By: Peter Sefton, Jenny Fewster, Moises Sacal Bonequi, Cale Johnstone, Catherine Travis, River Tae Smith, Patrick Carnuccio Edited by: Simon Musgrave The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC). The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities. The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Culture at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions. This work is supported by the Australian Research Data Commons. Last year at eResearch Australasia, the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) team presented a design for a distributed access control system which could look after the A-is-for-accessible in FAIR data; in this presentation, we describe and demonstrate a pilot system based on that design, showing how data licenses that allow access by identified groups of people to language data collections can be used with an AAF pilot system (CILogon) to give the right people access to data resources. The ARDC have invested in a pilot of this work as part of the HASS Research Data Commons and Indigenous Research Capability Program integration activities. The system has to be able to implement data access policies with real-world complexity and one of our challenges has been developing a data access policy that works across a range of different collections of language data. Here we present a pilot data access policy that we have developed, describing how this policy captures the decisions that must be made by a range of data providers to ensure data accessibility that complies with diverse legal, moral and ethical considerations. We will discuss how the CARE and FAIR principles underpin this work, and compare this work to other projects such as CADRE, which promise to deliver more complex solutions in the future. Initial work is with collections curated in a research context but we will also address community access to these resources. The idea is to separate safe storage of data from its delivery. Each item in a repository is stored with licensing information in natural language (English at the moment, but could be other languages) and the repository defers access decisions to an Authorization system, where data custodians can design whatever process they like for granting license access. This can range from simple click-through licenses where anyone can agree to license terms, to detailed multi-step workflows where applicants are vetted based on whatever criteria the rights holder wishes; qualifications, membership of a cultural group, have they paid a subscription fee, etc Regarding rights, our project is informed by the CARE principles for Indigenous data which also describe the level of respect which should be given to any data collected from individuals or communities.

There are a few reasons for the distributed approach we have taken in LDaCA: ACLs need maintenance over time - people’s identities change, they retire and die, so storing a list of identifiers such as email addresses alongside content is not a viable long-term preservation strategy. Rather, we will encourage data custodians to describe in words what are permitted uses for the data, and by whom, in a license, then allow whomever is the current data custodian to manage that access in a separate administrative system. We expect these administrative systems to be ephemeral, and change over time but also to generate less friction over time as standards are developed. Expected future benefits of concentrating these processes will include that people do not have to prove the same claims they make about themselves multiple times and that it is easier for data custodians to authorize access. LDaCA data will be stored in a variety of places with separate portal applications serving data for specific purposes; if these systems all have in-built authorization schemes, even if they are the same, then we have the problem of synchronizing access control lists around a network of services. Accessing data that requires some sort of authorization process is not language or humanities-specific, so working with an existing application that can handle pre-authorization workflows and access-control authorization decisions is an attractive choice and should allow LDaCA to take advantage of centrally managed services with functionality that improves over time rather than having to develop and maintain our own systems. If complex access controls are implemented inside a system then there is a risk that data becomes stranded inside that system and cannot be reused without completely re-implementing the access control. For example, imagine an archive of cultural material with complex access controls encoded into the business logic such as “this item is accessible only to male initiates”. Applications like this need to store user accounts with attributes on both data and user records that can be used to authorize access. There is a high risk of data being stranded in a system such as this if it is no longer supported. This will be mitigated somewhat if the rules are also expressed as licenses, perhaps a composition of Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels - but the access system is baked-in to the application and not portable.

The point of Research Data Commons projects like LDaCA is to create an ecosystem where data can be re-used. For language data, this means that users, including researchers and community members, will be able to download data for certain authorised purposes and activities. The license is the way that data custodians communicate to data users (and future administrators) what those purposes and activities are. A license, which is always packaged with data will allow: A user to inspect a five-year-old dataset in their downloads folder and work out what they are allowed to do with it. An IT professional to clean up a laptop that has been handed in by (or seized from – it happens) a departing faculty member. A developer to re-create an access control replacing a decommissioned system.

No, and Yes No, there is no lock-in regarding the list of Licenses and pre-authorized users; licenses and access control lists can be exported via an API so it is possible to import them into another system or save them for audit purposes. Yes, there is lock-in, in that at this stage the workflow used to give access to users is specific to the system (such as REMS) But, because our process requires a governance step first in writing a license, then there is a statement of intent for re-building those processes later if needed - a step which is very likely to be missing in a system with built-in access control. Also, over time, we expect the administrative burden of constructing workflows will become less as standards are developed for a couple of things: Licenses can be made less complex (particularly in the context of academic studies) if they specify re-use by particular known cohorts in advance - this comes down to improving the design of studies to encourage data reuse. This may also help to simplify academic ethics processes in the medium to long term. The CADRE project is looking to improve pre-authorization workflows that automatically source relevant information about potential users - fetching their publication record, and potentially remembering what certifications they have, so these attributes can be used and reused for decision-making. It is conceivable that this approach might be useful in cultural contexts as well to allow data custodians to manage data sharing - this is a discussion we have yet to have in the broader HASS RDC.

But all of the issues identified above with application-specific ACLs are the same, no matter the size of the cohort: the data set can’t be access controlled outside of its home system.

These slides briefly outline the AAF process for the next phase that will provide the foundations for the development of the service and the creation of those policies to support the community and the service. This process will support the project to deliver a viable service that meets researchers’ needs and is trusted by the community and the participants to safely distribute data to authorised persons. The AAF’s business analyst is conducting interviews with the key stakeholders. This discovery process will collect information on the current and the “to-be” state of the service. Together these will establish goals and expectations and provide the basis for further prototyping a service that meets stakeholder needs. The process will facilitate the building of a service that empowers the data custodians, the communities and participants to manage access.

My designs reflect my appreciation of the past and my hope for the future. The design of the LDaCA logo came from my own experience researching the Waanyi language, the language of my mob. The design flows from the beginning to the end, where it flows back into itself at the beginning, representing the cyclical nature of life and the Land. The strands of language interweave with themselves, influenced by everything that touches them until they become something entirely their own. The complexity of these languages is a thing of beauty and their preservation, study and proliferation lays claim to this unceded land. The inspiration of the design is as follows: L (Language) - Language is shown as a flow of words that can be merged, split and rearranged to create different meanings, just as these lines can be. D (Data) - Data is depicted by these specks of raw information, undecipherable before processing but heavy with power. a - This data is not just numbers and words but aspects of cultures and knowledge with connections to the land. C (Commons) - Whilst research often appears niche in these commons, there is no limit to the range of it’s influence, the ripples of which disrupt everything it touches. A (Australia) - The language data of this common has been collected from many individual nations that make up ‘Australia’, often with a foundation on extraction based research techniques. This project aims to make up for the mistakes of the past by celebrating and giving back to these nations, which are so incredibly distinct whilst sharing beautiful connections with each other. The colours utilised in this design draw from those that are seen in my peoples land of Boodjamulla, in the Gulf of Carpentaria (see below).

Thanks to Simon Musgrave for reviewing this and adding a little detail here and there. (This is also available on Dr Sefton’s site) PDF version The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are establishing a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC). The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities. For this Research Data Commons work, we are using the Arkisto Platform (introduced at eResearch 2020). Arkisto aims to secure the long-term preservation of data independently of code and services - recognizing the ephemeral nature of software and platforms. We know that sustaining software platforms can be hard and aim to make sure that important data assets are not locked up in a database or hard-coded logic of some hard-to-maintain application. We are using three key standards on this project … The first standard is the Oxford Common File Layout - this is a way of keeping version-controlled digital objects on a plain old filesystem or object store. Here’s the introduction to the spec: Introduction This section is non-normative. This Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification describes an application-independent approach to the storage of digital objects in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term access and management of digital objects within digital repositories. Need The OCFL initiative began as a discussion amongst digital repository practitioners to identify well-defined, common, and application-independent file management for a digital repository’s persisted objects and represents a specification of the community’s collective recommendations addressing five primary requirements: completeness, parsability, versioning, robustness, and storage diversity. Completeness The OCFL recommends storing metadata and the content it describes together so the OCFL object can be fully understood in the absence of original software. The OCFL does not make recommendations about what constitutes an object, nor does it assume what type of metadata is needed to fully understand the object, recognizing those decisions may differ from one repository to another. However, it is recommended that when making this decision, implementers consider what is necessary to rebuild the objects from the files stored. Parsability One goal of the OCFL is to ensure objects remain fixed over time. This can be difficult as software and infrastructure change, and content is migrated. To combat this challenge, the OCFL ensures that both humans and machines can understand the layout and corresponding inventory regardless of the software or infrastructure used. This allows for humans to read the layout and corresponding inventory, and understand it without the use of machines. Additionally, if existing software were to become obsolete, the OCFL could easily be understood by a lightweight application, even without the full feature repository that might have been used in the past. Versioning Another need expressed by the community was the need to update and change objects, either the content itself or the metadata associated with the object. The OCFL relies heavily on the prior art in the [Moab] Design for Digital Object Versioning which utilizes forward deltas to track the history of the object.

The corpus is divided into four time periods (1788–1825, 1826–1850, 1851–1875 and 1876–1900) each holding about 500,000 words. Four registers were defined for CoOEE: the Speech-based Register (SB), the Private Written Register (PrW), the Public Written Register (PcW) and the register of Government English (GE). For each time period, there is a similar number of words in the different registers. The Australian Corpus of English: The Australian Corpus of English (ACE) was compiled to match Australian data from 1986 with the American (Brown) and British (LOB) corpora of written English from the 1960s. It includes 500 samples of published texts taken from 15 different categories of nonfiction and fiction, including newspapers, reportage, editorials, reviews; magazines and journals: popular, academic; government and corporate documents; fiction monographs and short stories (both popular and literary). The International Corpus of English (Australian component): The Australian component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-AUS) is an approximately one million word corpus of transcribed spoken and written Australian English from 1992-1995. It consists of 500 samples of Australian English (60% speech, 40% writing) that matches the structure of other corpora associated with the International Corpus of English. Australian Radio Talkback: Australian Radio Talkback (ART) is a set of transcribed recordings of samples of national, regional and commercial Australian talkback radio from 2004 to 2006. It includes 27 audio recordings and transcripts of talkback from ABC National Radio, ABC Radio broadcasts to eastern Australia, ABC Radio broadcasts to southern and western Australia, as well as commercial stations broadcasting to eastern Australia and southern and western Australia. AustLit: The contribution from AustLit provides full-text access to select samples of out of copyright poetry, fiction and criticism ranging from 1795 to the 1930s. The collection includes literature intended for popular audiences as well as literature intended for audiences concerned with literary quality or the establishment of a national canon. Braided Channels: The Braided Channels research collection is constructed from some 70 hours of oral history interviews with women from Australia’s Channel Country, together with archival film, transcripts, photos and music. It includes both audiovisual recordings and transcripts of interviews. The La Trobe Corpus of Spoken Australian English: The La Trobe Corpus of Spoken Australian English comprises a collection of six recordings and transcriptions of spoken interaction amongst Australian speakers of English (some in conversation with native French speakers speaking English) made in Melbourne from 2001 to 2002. The speech of Australian adolescents: research data and recordings collected by A.G. Mitchell and Arthur Delbridge in 1959 and 1960: This dataset comprises 22,187 recordings of Australian English as spoken by 7,736 students at 330 schools across Australia and specific information about the speakers. The recordings were made on reel-to-reel tapes and were used to create the 1965 monograph The speech of Australian adolescents: a survey and the revised 1965 publication The pronunciation of English in Australia (originally published in 1946). The Australian National Corpus provided access to a sample of this material; the full dataset is now available. other datasets not yet available in the portal: Sydney Speaks: This project seeks to document and explore Australian English, as spoken in Australia’s largest and most ethnically and linguistically diverse city – Sydney.

But the rest of the world are bringing with them new approaches to how data is handled. This means that fields such as corpus linguistics may need to reassess their practices. Such reassessment includes addressing concerns about how data is stored and who can access it (data stewardship) – concerns that are a part of the Open Science movement, ultimately grounded on principles of equity and accountability. The most influential approach to data stewardship today is the FAIR principles. According to these principles, data should be: Findable Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Accessible Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation. Interoperable The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. Reusable The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. In general, corpus linguists do well on the interoperability criterion. Corpus data is usually stored in non-proprietary formats; even when some structure is imposed on the data, this is almost always in a form which is saved as a simple text file (e.g. CSV files or XML annotations). Data stored in such formats is easy to move between applications. But what about the other three criteria? Some corpus data is easy to discover; it is findable. For example, CLARIN, the portal to the European Union language resource infrastructure, provides access to many large data collections, as does the Linguistic Data Consortium in the USA. However, some data is never made part of a large collection and often remains under the control of individual researchers or research teams. Such data may be almost impossible to find. Even if we can find such data, it is unlikely to be accompanied by good descriptions of the data and metadata, making reusability problematic. Of course, big corpora such as the British National Corpus will be both findable and accompanied by comprehensive corpus manuals. However, it is worth considering how to make other corpora more findable, including the provision of corpus manuals or corpus descriptions. Corpus resource databases such as CoRD do aim to work towards this principle. Accessibility may also be an issue for some data. Copyright law may allow use of material for individual research but prohibit any further distribution of the material. The FAIR approach to such cases is that metadata should be available so that interested parties can know that a data holding exists (F), and the metadata will include information about the conditions under which the data may or may not be shared or reused (A and R). For linguists, there is another very important set of principles concerning data, the CARE principles developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance: Collective Benefit Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data. Authority to control Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Responsibility Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit. Ethics Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem. These principles are presented as applying particularly to Indigenous data, but we believe that researchers should adopt this approach in all cases where the people who partici","date":"2022-02-08","objectID":"/news/posts/fair-and-care/:0:0","tags":["FAIR","CARE"],"title":"What are the FAIR and CARE principles and why should corpus linguists know about them?","uri":"/news/posts/fair-and-care/"}]
