It provides researchers with a relatively simple way to describe their data using best practice in formal metadata description. Designed as a Vue component, Crate-O can be easily integrated into any Vue.js project. Simply install the component with npm and include it in your application. As a Vue software component, it can be used, cloned and distributed by anyone. Crate-O is implemented in the GitHub page Crate-O. This implementation works only with Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It does not link to other services, and as such, any data uploaded to Crate-O will not go anywhere other than populating your RO-Crate. We will be releasing versions that work with online resources directly, which will be compatible with other browsers (see the Roadmap). RO-Crate is a way of packaging research data that stores the data together with its associated metadata and other component files, such as the data license. It is a flexible, developer-friendly approach to linked-data description and packaging. While the current version of Crate-O is designed for editing self-contained RO-Crates (and works fine with crates containing tens of thousands of entities), our roadmap includes adding the ability to edit fragments of larger linked-data resources and to integrate with repositories, such as the Oni repository, data API and archival repositories such as the Language Data Commons of Australia.

Self-contained corpus crate with all resources Image Source: LDaCA The metadata is organised according to Schema.org entity types. Entity Definition Class rdfs:Class is used to classify resources. Classes in the Language Data Commons (LDAC) schema include CollectionEvent, CollectionProtocol, DataDepositLicense, DataLicense and DataReuseLicense (see https://w3id.org/ldac/terms). Property rdfs:Property is an attribute of an instance of a Class. For example, on an entity that is an instance of Class Person the property “name” would be their name, expressed as a text string, while “affiliation” would be a property that referenced another entity, their university. DefinedTerm A ‘word, name, acronym, phrase, etc. with a formal definition’, ‘often used in the context of category or subject classification.’ DefinedTerms allow us to a) have accurate definitions of the values we want to give to properties, and b) group such definitions in DefinedTermSets, which can function as controlled vocabularies. The table below shows an example of the relationship between each of these entities: Level Example Class Annotation ↓ ↓ Property annotationType ↓ ↓ Defined Term Set AnnotationTypeTerms ↓ ↓ Defined Terms Gestural, Phonemic, Phonetic, Phonological, Prosodic, Semantic, Syntactic, Transcription, Translation For more details on these and other metadata entities, see Metadata for Language Data.

This section explains what these components are and how they relate. The three main components for RO-Crate editing with Crate-O Image Source: LDaCA A Schema specifies a metadata vocabulary of Classes and Properties, based on the RO-Crate specification’s use of Schema.org classes. An RO-Crate Mode is a set of lightweight syntactic rules for combining Schema.org Style Schema (SOSS) Classes, Properties and DefinedTerms, expressed in a JSON file that can be: loaded into an editor such as Crate-O imported into another program and used for RO-Crate validation used to summarise the rules for an RO-Crate Profile. An RO-Crate Profile has (at least) a document that explains how metadata entities from the Schema are used for a particular purpose. These are all inter-related, and can be developed together or separately using tools.

Schema.org is defined as a set of Classes and Properties, each of which has an online definition. The below example illustrates that the base class Thing and its subclass Person has properties such as birthDate. Class: Thing → Sub-Class: Person → Property: birthDate Schema.org specifies which Classes can have particular Properties. While Schema.org has terms for Class and Property, it does not use these for defining the classes and properties in Schema.org itself (possibly as this would be circular). Rather, it uses the equivalent Classes from the rdf: and rdfs: vocabularies. Here is the definition for Person: { \"@id\": \"schema:Person\", \"@type\": \"rdfs:Class\", \"owl:equivalentClass\": { \"@id\": \"foaf:Person\" }, \"rdfs:comment\": \"A person (alive, dead, undead, or fictional).\", \"rdfs:label\": \"Person\", \"rdfs:subClassOf\": { \"@id\": \"schema:Thing\" }, \"schema:source\": { \"@id\": \"http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/SchemaDotOrgSources#source_rNews\" } } The Class definition does not have any information about the occurrence of properties – that is found in a Property definition: { \"@id\": \"schema:sibling\", \"@type\": \"rdf:Property\", \"rdfs:comment\": \"A sibling of the person.\", \"rdfs:label\": \"sibling\", \"schema:domainIncludes\": { \"@id\": \"schema:Person\" }, \"schema:rangeIncludes\": { \"@id\": \"schema:Person\" } } A SOSS is a Flattened JSON-LD graph, just like an RO-Crate. Some members of the RO-Crate community are beginning to define its basic schema and RO-Crate Profiles using the SOSS’s same approach. To make an RO-Crate Mode File, we transform the flat graph of a schema into something optimised for driving an editor or a validator; it creates a list of Classes, and what properties each may have.

Telling a good story starts with knowing the information that you want to convey and what is at the centre of your data. Combining the data with narrative can help convey complex information in a way that is relatable.

Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) is a way of packaging data — like audio recordings, photographs, manuscripts or teaching materials — together with their metadata (see video below). Metadata tells us information about the data, like who created it, when and in which languages. Think of a milk crate. We can put some groceries inside the milk crate, and we can also add in a list of our groceries. In an RO-Crate, the ‘groceries’ are your data and the ’list’ (or manifest) is your metadata and other descriptive files, such as a data license detailing use and access conditions. RO-Crate metadata files are written in JSON-LD format. The ‘crate’ is the folder on your computer where the data and metadata are located. An RO-Crate folder can also contain an HTML preview file. This file allows you to view your structured collection in a web browser, navigating through all the data in the crate with descriptions of the files, what they are, the people in the recordings and transcripts, etc. An RO-Crate HTML preview file created with browser-based editor Crate-O.

RO-Crates are used by two groups: Repositories, research projects and organisations with access to technical expertise Individual data stewards who may not have such expertise. The use cases for each of these two groups differ. At LDaCA, we use RO-Crate as the storage method for our data repository. Some collections are made up of a single RO-Crate and some are made up of multiple RO-Crates. RO-Crates make it possible to distribute and present the collection through our data portal. A single collection RO-Crate is often too large for distribution, especially if it includes audiovisual data. Additionally, many repositories, such as Zenodo, will only accept open data. This is a problem if different parts of your collection, like video material, have different access protocols. LDaCA can help data stewards prepare and transform their collections for distribution. This may involve breaking the collection into ‘chunks’ for better processing. In this post, we outline five benefits of the RO-Crate method in caring for language materials.

RO-Crates are easy to upload and download An RO-Crate can contain large amounts of various types of files, like video and audio recordings, ELAN files or text files.

ZIP format compresses multiple files and folders into one smaller file for easier transfer and storage. Because RO-Crates are easy to upload, they are a good format for transferring data to archives and repositories or for adding to a website. Because they are easy to download, your data will not get locked into a website or database software.

RO-Crates maintain the access information for a collection and its files RO-Crates require that you write clear licensing statements to travel with the data. A license documents the conditions for access and use of the materials. Each RO-Crate should have one license at the top level. This should be the most restrictive license needed. Note that most public repositories will only accept open access data, but LDaCA can accept language data that requires access controls. If different parts of your collection have different access conditions, LDaCA can help to separate the collection into multiple RO-Crates, each with its own license. We use the different licenses to create an access control system for our data portal. Chunking your collection into multiple crates means that different people can have different levels of access to it in our portal. Read more about data licensing in our access conditions resource.

RO-Crates ensure that data travels with its metadata In an RO-Crate, the metadata file is usually stored in the same folder as the data it describes. An RO-Crate metadata file can also describe remote items, such as web pages, which are not stored in the folder. The metadata describes each file, as well as the whole collection. The licensing statement is also stored in this folder. When data and its metadata and licensing aren’t stored together, they can get separated.

RO-Crates allow for flexible metadata description Useful metadata follows some kind of ‘standard’ — an agreed language to describe the same ideas. Standard metadata makes it easier to search across collections and to compare them. It also means the data steward isn’t responsible for maintaining metadata vocabularies. But what happens when a metadata term that you need isn’t covered in an existing metadata standard? RO-Crate uses Schema.org as its foundation for metadata description, as well as a few other standard vocabularies, such as Dublin Core. To supplement this, LDaCA has also developed the Language Data Commons Schema, which provides terms of particular relevance in describing language data collections, for example, linguisticGenre and translator. In cases where your collection’s metadata requirements aren’t covered by these vocabularies, RO-Crate also allows you to define custom terms. This means you can define your metadata to appropriately describe your collection. The custom terms and their descriptions are also recorded in the RO-Crate, so they’re understood by others looking at the collection. Schema.org metadata terms.

After an undergraduate degree in linguistics, Nick worked with various Indigenous groups, before creating a handbook of languages in Western Australia and then helping to set up the Wangka Maya Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre in Port Hedland. That experience, together with an interest in harnessing new technologies, took Nick to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) in Canberra, before a period of living in Vanuatu, where he also collected data on the Nafsan (South Efate) language, the topic of his doctoral dissertation. Documenting the Nafsan language reinforced Nick’s commitment to making enduring and high-quality records of cultural and linguistic material, and when he returned to Australia, he was part of the group which founded the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC), of which he is now Director. During a period at the University of Hawai’i, Nick set up the Kaipuleohone digital archive. Other aspects of Nick’s work have included leading a stream in the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language, serving as Deputy Director of the Research Unit for Indigenous Languages at UniMelb, assisting in the founding of the journal Language Documentation \u0026 Conservation and now being a Chief Investigator in LDaCA.

Image Source: Nick Thieberger (NT — Nick Thieberger, SM — Simon Musgrave, BL — Bridey Lea)1 SM: When the group of people involved started PARADISEC, did you see it as being a solution for long term storage? NT: When we started PARADISEC, we mainly saw it as a way of digitising a whole lot of material that was at risk. We didn’t see it as a long term storage, we saw it as a transitional phase. So the material would be digitised, it would be described, and at some point, the national data infrastructure would be able to accommodate it. That was our plan. And so I suppose what’s happened is, since then we’ve shepherded that material through, and we’re still waiting for the national data fabric to catch up. For the current phase, PARADISEC has taken on a role of curating the material that it has. So it won’t be permanent storage. It will be whatever we can do to keep it going now, and we really do hope that there will be some national infrastructure which can deal with these kinds of material. It’s not just the material, but it’s the way that it’s curated, right? So that you have metadata, you have licence conditions, you have ways of accessing the material that PARADISEC provides, and ideally, that’s what a national service would provide. Unlike what we typically have from universities and institutions, which is storage. And storage is OneDrive or Sharepoint or so many of these things which don’t give you good accessibility. They’re usually tied into a particular university environment. There are many reasons why those things aren’t sufficient for the kinds of material that we work with. BL: I might take us back a bit. I’m curious about what your first data collections looked like, as an early career researcher, and also in setting up Wangka Maya. What was that like and how did that look in terms of your data storage? NT: Right, early collections. Well, I suppose the first collection that I really worked with was at Edith Cowan University, which was then the West Australian College of Advanced Education. I built a repository of information about West Australian Aboriginal languages, which were files — drop files (suspension files). So this was not dynamic media, it was all analogue, and that went into the Handbook of WA Aboriginal Languages (Figure 2)2. The handbook had little code numbers which related to the primary material that was in those drop files, and after I left that institution, they threw it all out.

Read on to find out Mark’s tip for working with metadata. When it comes to metadata, consistency is key. What this means is that, within your collection, it is best to use the same terms for the same data, rather than changing how you describe data over time. It also means that, if possible, it is better to use an existing metadata schema to describe your materials — whether this is Schema.org, Dublin Core, Portland Common Data Model or even a combination of different schemas, depending on which schema best describes the data that you have to hand. If you are using terms from a range of different metadata schemas, it is always best to identify which metadata schema the term comes from. If you absolutely cannot find a term in a metadata schema that matches the data that you have collected, then you can create your own terms, but when you share the data with others, then it is best practice to have a definition for all the terms that you have created included with the data. Because we are using RO Crates in LDaCA, where possible, terms in the incoming data will be mapped to an equivalent Schema.org or LDAC OLAC-derived term. The best place to start looking for an appropriate metadata schema is in our documentation. Mark in action, lower right, demonstrating data migration to RO-Crate.

Image Source: LDaCA Moises Sacal Bonequi introduced a structured set of guidelines for designing and evaluating data storage services (PILARS). This framework ensures that digital assets, such as research data, are securely managed and accessible for the long term. Nick Thieberger joined the workshop virtually to demonstrate Nyingarn, a workspace for working with handwritten or typed manuscripts. The platform can help with making digital formats of manuscripts searchable, while maintaining a secure environment for sensitive material. Ben and Rosanna Smith then introduced RO-Crate and Crate-O. Ben used a physical crate as a metaphor to explain the RO-Crate approach to packaging data. He explained how RO-Crate is a method for bundling materials (like audio files, images or manuscripts) with their associated metadata. Rosanna also shared a demonstration of Crate-O, a browser-based platform that can help users convert their materials and metadata into an RO-Crate format.

Along the way, an important insight emerged: not all spreadsheet programs are equal. While tools like Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers and Google Sheets might seem interchangeable, subtle differences in formatting and formula handling can lead to unexpected results. This realisation proved to be a valuable learning moment and will help with refining the application of RO-Crate standards and improve instructional materials.

During this session, they compared data fields across their organisations’ metadata, identifying similarities and variations. For instance, fields like ‘Name’ and ‘Title’ were sometimes used interchangeably, while other variations arose based on the unique needs of specific collections. Some organisations required broader or more specialised data fields to account for the diverse nature of their materials. Although fully standardising field names isn’t always practical, the discussion inspired ideas for fostering greater connections between metadata fields, where possible.

Varying approaches to file management and digital storage Organisations, depending on their size and complexity, rely on a variety of digital storage systems, practices and processes to meet their needs. While these solutions address specific requirements, they also come with their own set of challenges and opportunities. Implementing robust backup and recovery strategies is essential, but can require significant resources. Similarly, building and sustaining a dedicated team to manage and maintain these systems over the long term is important, but requires significant commitment and effort. Utilising simple tools Digital tools and platforms that users are already familiar with — such as smartphones, Facebook and YouTube — are often used and can be effective for sharing materials. Empowering communities to shape and guide processes of working with language materials ensures resources remain accessible and widely used. However, this approach requires careful consideration, as the evolving nature of these platforms and their procedures can affect the security and long-term availability of shared materials.

Attendees of the Arne ingkerreke apurtelhe-ileme launch at Batchelor Institute. Image Source: Charlee-Ann Ah Chee Veronica Dobson is an Eastern Arrernte elder, linguist, educator, author and ecologist, whose advocacy and work for language and culture is widely recognised and deeply respected. For over four decades, Veronica has worked in many inter-related fields — language documentation and teaching, lexicography, interpreting, ethnobiology and land management. The result is a vast body of work, which is presented for the first time through Arne ingkerreke apurtelhe-ileme. The veronicadobson.au website is a guide to Veronica’s life, work and publications, and contains links to archival collections of her work. Veronica’s daughter, Camille Dobson, spoke about the process of creating this collection at the recent launch. “Over the past year I was privileged to work with Ben Foley, Jenny Green and Ange Harrison on this project, which places the Aboriginal knowledge holder at the center of the collection. It is an important collection and now means that her amazing work can be found in one place,” she said. In June last year, CALL partnered with LDaCA to develop a ‘person-centred collection’. Many archival collections revolve around non-Indigenous collectors, like linguists and anthropologists, who have recorded and accumulated material over their lifetime. Person-centred collections reframe our focus and enhance our understanding of the collection items by showing them as the cohesive work of an Aboriginal knowledge holder. “I knew my mum, Veronica Perrurle Dobson, had contributed much to the language that she loves, but until I worked on this project, really didn’t understand just how much, and there is more to come,” said Camille. Veronica’s intention for Arne ingkerreke apurtelhe-ileme is that the fruits of her work are cared for and accessible for future generations. For Camille, the collection also has the potential to inspire. “Still working at 80, Mum is an inspiration to our family. I hope others will also be inspired by her passion, dedication and story,” she said. Veronica’s dedication to and passion for language and culture fills the project website, and it is certainly an achievement to celebrate. Do not miss the Recollections page; this is a very special opportunity to hear about Veronica’s life, from her birth at Arltunga and her attendance at the Catholic Mission school there, to the early days of her work with the Institute for Aboriginal Development (IAD). “For me, what I have done has not been like work. I do what I do because I love my language and know how important it is – this is the knowledge I learned from my grandparents.” —Veronica Dobson Veronica Perrurle Dobson celebrates the launch of Arne ingkerreke apurtelhe-ileme.

For example, most of us in Australia (well, over a certain age anyway!) will recognise the expression technicolour yawn and might even associate it with Barry Humphries’ creation Barry McKenzie. But what sort of evidence is there of people actually using the phrase? Figure 1: The cover of The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke. Image Source: Simon Musgrave In the article, I examine three examples of this type of slang: the language which C.J. Dennis attributes to his Sentimental Bloke (Figure 1), the language of Barry McKenzie and the language presented by the writers of The Betoota Advocate (Figure 2) in their 2021 book, Betootaisms. The case of Dennis is a little different to the other two. We have very little evidence of how people spoke in Australia (specifically, in Melbourne) early in the 20th century, and it is therefore not possible to make the case that Dennis used expressions which he invented, rather than ones which he observed (but, nevertheless, I think I make a reasonable case that his work is part of a tradition which encompasses the other two examples). For Betootaisms, it is easy to use web search engines to look for evidence of usage (spoiler alert: there is little such evidence outside of the pages of The Betoota Advocate). But what about Barry McKenzie? The character was created in 1964 and was perhaps most prominent in the 1970s, when two films were made centred on him. I needed data showing language used in Australia later than that period, so that I could check whether the expressions used by Barry McKenzie had a wider currency or not.

I looked for these words, and also the expressions technicolour yawn and chunder, in a large corpus of Australian newspaper articles (compiled by linguists at Lancaster University’s Corpus Approaches to Social Science research centre) consisting of nearly 13,000 articles and close to 7.4 million words.

Unfortunately, this collection cannot be shared for copyright reasons — we would love to include it in LDaCA — but I happen to have a copy (for personal study only, of course). Figure 3: The cover of The Wonderful World of Barry McKenzie. Image Source: Simon Musgrave Searching for the words mentioned above in this corpus gave the following results: In the newspaper corpus, jeez occurs twice, poms occurs 16 times, and burl and bonzer do not appear at all. As noted above, the expression technicolour yawn is recognized by many as Australian slang, but it also does not appear in this corpus. Looking at another word for vomiting which Barry McKenzie uses frequently, chunder, we find a single instance which is an indirect reference to the original meaning: Reflecting on the Thunder’s unlikely run to this season’s final, Khawaja revealed there were times during the club’s lean years when he asked himself whether he wanted to be in a team derided as “The Chunder” and considered the competition’s basket case. (The Sydney Morning Herald, 23/01/2016, p. 53) This last word chunder is particularly interesting, because its history has been traced outside the work of Barry Humphries (Figure 4). It certainly existed before Barry McKenzie used it — see Greens’ Dictionary of Slang. Indeed, Humphries relates that he learned it at school (as recounted by Bruce Moore (2010, p. 42)). Greens’ dictionary has citations up until 2016, but the newspaper data suggest that it is losing currency. In the corpus, the synonyms vomit and spew have four and two instances, respectively. Figure 4: Barry Humphries. Image Source: Wikimedia In the initial version of my article submitted for review, I used these results to argue that there was little evidence that the language Barry Humphries had attributed to Barry McKenzie was actually used in Australian English. The article was part of a special issue of the journal, which meant that my submission was reviewed by the special issue editors (Isabelle Burke and Dylan Hughes) and an external reviewer. The comments of the external reviewer were sympathetic and helpful, and included a query as to whether I had sufficiently made the case for the absence of the relevant expressions from actual language use. Thinking about this again, I realised that the query was legitimate: the time gap between the heyday of Barry McKenzie and the data I looked at was too great. I needed to look at earlier data from the last two decades of the 20th century, if possible.

LDaCA has three collections of data which were relevant to my needs: The Australian Corpus of English was compiled to match Australian data from 1986 with the American (Brown) and British (Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen) corpora of written English from the 1960s. It includes 500 samples of published texts taken from 15 different categories of nonfiction and fiction, including newspapers, reportage, editorials, reviews; magazines and journals: popular, academic; government and corporate documents; fiction monographs and short stories (both popular and literary). The Australian component of the International Corpus of English (ICE) is an approximately one million word corpus of transcribed spoken and written Australian English from 1992–1996. It consists of 500 samples of Australian English (60% speech, 40% writing) that matches the structure of other ICE corpora. The spoken data includes recordings and transcriptions of face-to-face spoken conversations, telephone conversations, monologues, broadcast dialogues and scripted speech. The written texts include samples of unpublished letters (personal and professional), student essays, newspaper writing, popular nonfiction, academic writing and fiction. Australian Radio Talkback includes 14 transcribed recordings of talkback from ABC National Radio, ABC Radio broadcasts to eastern Australia, and ABC Radio broadcasts to southern and western Australia, as well as 15 transcribed recordings of talkback radio from commercial stations broadcasting to eastern Australia, and southern and western Australia. The material was collected in the early 2000s. Each of these collections was previously part of the Australian National Corpus (AusNC) — this post explains the historical relationship between AusNC and LDaCA. I conducted searches across these sources, which confirmed my hypothesis that there is little evidence for actual use of the expressions Humphries put in the mouth of Barry McKenzie. I wrote the following in the article — it is clear that some of the absences are due to the effect of time, but I don’t think that such effects account for all the gaps: Searching these sources for the four terms used on the cover of the first Barry McKenzie book finds 11 hits for jeez (of which one is in another collection and dates from 1936), eight hits for pom and poms, two hits for bonzer/bonza (of which one is a metalinguistic comment), and no hits for burl. Chunder and technicolour yawn are both absent from these sources. Searching these data sources available through LDaCA made me confident that many of the words Barry McKenzie uses are not commonly used in Australia and strengthened the argument I had presented in the earlier version of my article.

For example, Dennis defines hang-over as ’the aftermath of the night before’, Humphries defines armful of chairs as ‘Something some people would not know whether you were up them with or not with’ and Betootaisms defines sunburnt sudoku as ‘The boat ramp, A needlessly complicated stretch of concrete surrounded by great minds’. But, the fun didn’t last for me. Figure 4: C.J. Dennis at work. Image Source: Public Domain Some of the questions which I tried to answer in the article are why it is that these literary expressions, which are not being used in everyday speech, are nevertheless recognised by many speakers of Australian English, and why do we find it easy to imagine that a dinkum Aussie could use them. The argument which I develop is that the three sources reflect a set of values which are quite consistent over the more than 100 years covered by my sample. All of them share attitudes to ethnic and cultural background, gender and relations between the sexes, and to the use of alcohol, and what is (at least, implicitly) expressed is not encouraging. As I say in the abstract of the article, there are “recurring themes across this 100-year tradition, showing that the world in which this language is grounded is one where white males who like alcohol are prominent”. I also referred to another dataset from LDaCA in discussing the relative absence of Indigenous Australians from the language I was investigating. The Betoota Advocate purports to represent the opinions and world view of a rural community in the Channel Country of western Queensland. To highlight how Indigenous peoples were represented in Betootaisms, I was able to make a comparison with the oral history material from the same location in the Braided Channels collection (also listed in LDaCA). Despite the somewhat depressing conclusion above, I hope that this account of my research gives you an idea of how research infrastructure, such as LDaCA, can assist in the process of research. I used the data from LDaCA to resolve a small question in the development of my argument, but having the answer to that small question was an essential step in building, what I hope, is a convincing position. Not having easy access to the data would have meant spending a lot of time looking for alternative sources or having a weak link in my argument. I am very happy that I did not have to accept either of those possibilities.

As the Indigenous Data Network (IDN) notes, it is: \"...information, in any format or medium, collected, analysed, stored, and interpreted within the context of Indigenous individuals, collectives, populations, entities, lifeways, cultures, knowledge systems, lands, biodiversity, water and other resources. It includes data collected, used, or stored by any agency, department, laboratory, organisation, corporation, statutory body, university or research institute, conducted by, with, and about Indigenous people or people, and data that Indigenous communities have generated and maintained themselves.\" Embedding both FAIR and CARE principles is essential when working with Indigenous data. While FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) provide the technical framework for data management, CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) help to centre Indigenous self-determination and worldviews. By integrating both sets of principles, we can develop data-sharing practices that are technically robust and respectful of diverse communities. To ensure Indigenous data is managed ethically and equitably, here are a small selection of examples of CAREful FAIRness Principles for Indigenous Data Governance: When making data Findable: Use terminology that respects cultural knowledge and consider whether any terms used might be offensive to any particular group. Include metadata descriptions and keywords in language. Consider providing oral documentation in language, alongside written descriptions, for cultures that have strong ties to oral practices. When making data Accessible: Offer multiple modes of access, such as downloadable files, web-based interfaces and even physical copies, where necessary. Work with Community Champions to translate data documentation, metadata and user instructions into languages commonly spoken within the community. When making data Interoperable: Incorporate Indigenous knowledge and traditional practices into interoperability standards by ensuring that data schemas accommodate both scientific classifications and traditional ecological knowledge. If the dataset includes geographical information, make sure that it is inclusive of multiple location naming conventions and local place names. When making data Reusable: Document all potential biases in data collection, and provide suggestions on how to interpret and analyse the data in a culturally sensitive manner. Acknowledge Indigenous communities or other cultural groups whose knowledge or data is being used. Provide documentation and guidelines on their intellectual property rights in relation to the knowledge or data being made available.

This event brought together a panel of three speakers — Lesley Acres (UQ Library), Dr Rose Barrowcliffe (Macquarie University and LDaCA) and Robert McLellan (UQ and LDaCA). The discussion was facilitated by Grant Sarra. Rose Barrowcliffe is Butchulla and is a post-doctoral research fellow at Macquarie University and an Honorary Senior Research Fellow at UQ.

His work has led to increased self-determination, operational success and substantial additional funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and communities. The panellists explored topics of data accessibility and discoverability, Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP), and tools and methods for Indigenous Data Governance (ID-Gov). What follows is a summarised version of the panellists’ contributions organised around the main themes of the discussion.1 Key takeaways for Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) sector workers looking to implement ID-Gov strategies in their collections were the importance of employing First Nations staff and working in respectful partnership with communities.

Rose Barrowcliffe (Figure 2) reflected on these challenges, describing her entry into the archival sector: I came into that space from my own personal experience of trying to access archival records that were about my Country, that were in an archive. The archive specifically was about my Country, and it was named using our language name of all things, yet we were told it wasn't really relevant to us. It was owned and managed by an institution. (RB) Rose went on to say that negative experiences of accessing materials held in large collecting institutions are common in communities and identified two critical challenges for community access. Firstly, most collecting institutions facilitate access to materials through slow, analogue processes. If used appropriately, however, new technologies and machine learning offer exciting opportunities for institutions to support discoverability and access in ways that have not been possible before. Of course, implementing these changes requires collecting institutions to be resourced for this kind of work, which should be done in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Secondly, some collecting institutions carry a misunderstanding of ‘Indigenous data’. Indigenous data is expansive and includes all data by, about or for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It includes data collected, used or stored by any agency, department, laboratory, organisation, corporation, statutory body, university or research institute conducted by, with and about Indigenous peoples, communities or their Country, and data that Indigenous communities have generated and maintained themselves. Embracing this definition requires structural change and a ’letting go’ of some of the control which collecting institutions are constructed around. A fuller understanding of Indigenous data opens up better pathways to recognise ICIP within collections. ICIP asserts that the authority for knowledge should remain with the original creators and holders of that knowledge. Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property reasserts the authority of Indigenous people to say, \"It actually doesn't matter where that knowledge sits and what form it takes, the knowledge and authority for that knowledge always remains with the Indigenous people that that has come from.\" (RB) Importantly, Rose added that collecting institutions who engage with ICIP are better equipped to build frameworks for ID-Gov.

Three roles are described by Rose and others (2024) in the article Indigenous Data Governance in Australia: Towards a National Framework: Data owners are those who have legal rights over the materials. Data custodians are those who provide storage and access services. Data stewards are those who process data in different ways. Robert commented that: When we talk about the archives, you've got, in many instances, a government who is asserting that it is all three of these things. (RM) When Indigenous data has been collected as ‘archival records’, contemporary government departments and agencies acquire a practical authority associated with the role of data owner. The data is also held within their systems and under their care. Rose added that: The reason it's so important is that it causes a lot of frustration when people don't understand the different roles. If I think about the Queensland State Archives, they're the custodians of state records, but they're not the owners. The owner remains the state department or agency that created those records. (RB) Being transparent about these roles will improve accountability in institutions and work to address frustration about access to materials in communities. Figure 3: Robert McLellan.

Lesley and her team developed an audit methodology to survey materials and enrich their metadata. They refined the methodology using four collections that were identified as high priority: Vocabularies of four representative tribes of South Eastern Queensland (F3843) Oodgeroo Noonuccal Papers (UQFL84) Record of visit to mission stations (Norman Nelson Collection) (UQFL57) Caroline Kelly Papers (UQFL489). The process uncovered gaps in the library's metadata and was a means of: Giving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people control over their own knowledges... Those four collections had never been audited. Back then, there were three of us — three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women — who were looking at that information, and when we started, the first one we looked at was Caroline Tennant Kelly's papers. By the time we finished auditing that collection, we found over 200 people listed in her fieldnotes, 47 we recognised as contributors. That collection was so significant in that we met with LinkUp QLD, and they now use that collection to help connect their clients to ancestors. (LA) Figure 4: Lesley Acres.

You need to look at what your institution stands for, what it's represented and what it's done in the past. (LA) It is important for collecting institutions to investigate their legacy. A core principle of ICIP is free, prior and informed consent, which can be difficult to determine for historical collections. In some cases, we might know that permissions were not obtained, or that they were collected, but not in ways that are current best practice. In other cases, we might not have any information about the provenance of and permissions surrounding historical materials. Collecting institutions can work to build partnerships, and invest financial and staffing resources, where this is possible, into this reflective and investigative work. Lesley described this type of work as a “cultural learning journey.” ","date":"2025-01-29","objectID":"/news/posts/id-gov-panel-2024/:3:3","tags":null,"title":"Indigenous data governance: A discussion","uri":"/news/posts/id-gov-panel-2024/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Employing First Nations staff Another key takeaway from Lesley’s work at UQ Library is the need for Indigenous staff in collecting institutions. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be employed at all levels to contribute to and lead ID-Gov. You need Indigenous staff. You cannot do this without us — because we have the knowledge, we have the understanding, we have the lived experiences. (LA) For Robert, collecting institutions are built around Western governance frameworks, which are not equipped to handle Indigenous knowledge systems. Indigenous communities asking the question, “How do I see myself reflected in this piece of digital infrastructure?”, need to see representation within institutions. Rose posed an additional prompt for collectives working with data, asking the question, “Who is in the room having conversations about Indigenous data?” Lived experience also plays an important role in decision making around technology and digital infrastructure for archival collections. Technology is always an amazing opportunity, if it's used in the right way, but you have to have people who have the lived experience of using it the wrong way too.

(LA) Lesley’s team at UQ Library developed a ‘Social and Emotional Wellbeing’ toolkit to support Indigenous and non-Indigenous library workers. The toolkit gave them space to “express, reflect, and digest.” In relation to community safety, the panellists stressed that it is important for communities to decide their own capacity to engage with archival records and collecting institutions. It's important to remember that Indigenous Data Governance is Indigenous community members or Indigenous communities deciding for themselves. (RB) When communities are not ready to engage with archival processes, this can be an indicator that now is not the right time to engage with those materials. For communities juggling competing concerns of housing, employment, health or education, collections and library services might be very low priority. As Lesley said, “Every consultation process will be different” and should go “at community’s pace.” We are grateful to all three of the panellists for their theoretical and practical insights into Indigenous Data Governance, as well as to Grant Sarra for facilitating the discussion. 1 This summary was prepared by Bridey Lea, with helpful comments from the panellists, Teresa Chan and Simon Musgrave. ↩ ","date":"2025-01-29","objectID":"/news/posts/id-gov-panel-2024/:5:0","tags":null,"title":"Indigenous data governance: A discussion","uri":"/news/posts/id-gov-panel-2024/"},{"categories":null,"content":"A guide for logging in to LDaCA REMS.","date":"2025-01-20","objectID":"/resources/user-guides/rems/login/","tags":null,"title":"REMS Login","uri":"/resources/user-guides/rems/login/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Follow Login Prompts Log in to LDaCA REMS via Account \u003e User Information Users log in to LDaCA REMS in different ways: Follow login prompts: typical for LDaCA Portal visitors and potential data users Upon selecting a data object with access restrictions, follow the login prompts presented on the webpage.

Form In brief: Decide if the default form (explained below) is suitable and adequate for your purposes. If so, you do not have to create a new form. REMS will automatically launch the default form for Applicants. Alternatively, you can create a new form by building on the default form using different form fields. In LDaCA REMS, a form is the license application form or interface through which an Applicant may view the license, accept the terms and submit the application for approval. Owners can create a customised form with additional fields that can, for example, ask the Applicant to provide more information (e.g. contact information, copy of a research proposal, answers to a questionnaire). Permissions are granted only when the Resource Owner (data steward or their designated Handler or Approver) approves the application. 3.1 Default License Application Form A default license application form is generated in LDaCA REMS when no form is connected to a catalogue item: REMS: No Form Image Source: LDaCA Below is the Applicant’s view of the default license application form: REMS: Default License Application Form Image Source: LDaCA This form is suitable for a basic workflow where an application is done in three steps: Log in to the LDaCA Portal and LDaCA REMS; Confirm acceptance of the license terms by clicking Accept license; Submit the license application by selecting Submit application.

Resource LDaCA REMS manages data license entitlement, hence the resources are the licenses. Linking the license to data objects is done in the backend for Resource Owners by LDaCA. 4.1 Create a Resource You cannot edit the resource after you have created and saved it. You can disable and archive a superseded resource and create a new one. In Administration \u003e Resources, select Create resource. A blank Create resource window appears: REMS: Create Resource Image Source: LDaCA Fill in the fields Organization, Resource identifier and Licenses. Organization: select from the drop-down list.

View this list in Administration \u003e Deny List. Deny listing is always connected to a certain resource. This means that a user can still apply for access to other resources even if they have been blocked from applying to a certain resource. The difference between revoking a user’s entitlement and simply adding a user to the Deny List: Revoking a user’s entitlement to a resource prevents the user from accessing the data protected by the license and also adds the user to the Deny List. See procedure Revoke Entitlements. Directly adding a user to the Deny List of a resource does not automatically block access to the data by a user that has previously been granted permissions. The Owner and Handler(s) are notified if anyone in the Deny List applies for access rights to the same resource. You can automatically reject new applications from denied users by adding Rejecter Bot in the Handler field of the resource’s workflow (see 5 Workflows). Revoke Entitlements Handlers and Resource Owners assigned as Handlers can revoke a user’s resource entitlements e.g. if users misuse their access rights. You can access the Revoke entitlement action from the relevant application form. It helps to know the application ID (which is in the format YYYY/##, e.g. 2024/28), otherwise perform a search or browse the Processed applications list from the Actions menu (explained below).

Workflow The Resource Owner must create a workflow for their resource (i.e. the data license). In a workflow, the Owner must assign Handlers and connect the workflow to a form and license. 5.1 Create a Workflow About Handler Bots Handlers are assigned in the workflow, and therefore it is important to be familiar with the types of Handler Bots available in LDaCA REMS (which can be found in the Handlers drop-down selection list). Approver Bot: Automates the approval of license applications. It will approve a submitted application if the Applicant accepts the license terms. Rejecter Bot: Automatically rejects applications from users who are in the Deny List for the resource in question. Expirer Bot: Removes applications and sends a notification email to Applicants and Handlers about the impending expiration of an entitlement, if applicable. Create a Workflow Go to Administration \u003e Workflows Select Create workflow The Create workflow window displays: REMS: Create Workflow Image Source: LDaCA Fill in the fields: Organization: Select from the drop-down list Title: Enter a title for your workflow. This title will be displayed in the Title column of the Workflows list. Choose a workflow type: Default workflow: The Handler is in full control of the application process. The Handler may request reviews and decisions from others as needed. Resource Owners can assign themselves or other persons as Handlers. Adding the Approver Bot as Handler automates the approval of license applications. See more in About Handler Bots. Decider workflow: The Handler does not have the authority to approve or reject, but only a separate Decider does. Handlers: A role assigned by an Owner to a user who is responsible for approving or rejecting the applications to resources. Handlers can also revoke an Applicant’s access rights in case of misuse. Choose from the Handlers selection drop-down list Resource Owners may assign themselves as Handler, too, in order to receive notifications about license applications (see REMS Notifications). Forms: Select the relevant form from the drop-down list of forms. Licenses: Select the relevant license from the drop-down list of licenses. Click Save when done. Let people know they have been assigned a Handler role; REMS does not send out notifications about this. Having multiple Handlers is recommended to help expedite the approval process.

She has carried out fieldwork on Indigenous Australian languages since 1979 and received a PhD in linguistics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1983 for a study of Warlpiri in the Lexical-Functional Grammar framework. She then worked in Central Australia on Warumungu language and language maintenance, and helped set up a language centre in Tennant Creek. In 1987–1989, with David Nash, she worked as lexicography fellow at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIATSIS), helping set up a digital archive of Aboriginal language material, which became the Aboriginal Studies Electronic Data Archive (ASEDA). In 1989, she became a lecturer in Linguistics at The University of Sydney, and then in 2011, she moved to ANU as the inaugural chair of Indigenous linguistics and head of the School of Language Studies (2011–2014). In 2014, the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL) was established, and she acted as Deputy Director until the Centre came to a natural end in 2022. Jane is a Project Advisor and a member of the Steering Committee of the Language Data Commons of Australia. Figure 1: Jane Simpson, Professor Emerita at the Australian National University (ANU). Image Source: ANU Our discussion with Jane was the first in a series of interviews we are conducting on the topic of long-term storage of language data. We asked Jane about current possibilities for storing language data, obstacles to its long-term storage, her interest in making dictionaries accessible and how researchers at the end of their careers should manage data. What follows is an edited version of Jane’s comments organised around the main themes of the discussion1.

Other countries, such as America (USA), don’t have anything similar. I can give digital copies of Aboriginal language material to AIATSIS and the reasons for depositing there are that it: is funded for the long term is a statutory authority has an act which says it’s supposed to preserve material and make it accessible. So, it is the obvious place to put material on Indigenous languages. I can also put material in PARADISEC, which I’ve done for some non-Indigenous stuff, like recordings made in field methods classes that I’ve run. PARADISEC has a very inclusive approach and that makes it easy for people to put things there. So it’s been terrific as a way of getting material online, and a fair bit of Australian language material is actually up and available through PARADISEC. But it’s not funded for the long term in the way that AIATSIS is. Another potential option would have been the National Library of Australia. It’s the national deposit institution, and therefore, I would have thought, if anything is published electronically in Australia on Australian topics, it should be held at the National Library. But they recognise they face large challenges in archiving complex digital materials. Lack of funding is part of the problem.

In the case of the Aboriginal Child Language Acquisition (ACLA) project, there is another problem in that it’s data involving children. It was recorded when they were children and they’re now grown-ups. During CoEDL, we funded some of the researchers to go back and try to get permissions from those participants to have their material archived and/or publicly available, but it’s extremely difficult, time-consuming and expensive to go back and get permissions, especially when you’ve got natural conversation with a number of different speakers. So, currently, that data is stored on Mediaflux at The University of Melbourne, and it’s in a bit of a hiatus as to what should eventually happen to it. My conscience is certainly not clear on the fact that it’s still sitting there and neither Jill Wigglesworth nor I have done anything about getting it into a long-term repository, such as AIATSIS.

There is a governance question — about whether material is accessible and how to make it accessible — but there seems to me also a moral question — an imperative — that this material is valuable, and if it can’t be made publicly accessible at the moment, fine, but that doesn’t prevent you from storing it. I feel pretty convinced that the wrong attitude is ‘You shouldn’t do anything with such material’, because we know how easy it is with digital material to lose it. I honestly can’t see why long-term digital storage is such a problem. If the National Library or AIATSIS can’t actually store digital recordings with appropriate catalogue metadata and make it accessible without formal permission from all the speakers recorded, then fine, keep it in a grey archive. We don’t really have an idea what grey archives would be like, though we know that they’re needed. In a way, the Nyingarn workspace is a bit like a grey archive. It’s kind of a holding place, a holding paddock, but only for the short term. We still need a long-term holding paddock. Figure 2: A manuscript document and its text version being edited in Nyingarn. Image Source: Paul Williams LDaCA can certainly emphasise to data stewards that the material is valuable, and that they shouldn’t be put off from trying to preserve it by the fact that they haven’t got the required permissions for making it public. Data stewards should not throw up their hands and say, ‘Oh, well, I’ll just keep it on my laptop.’ It is simply unrealistic with legacy material to expect retired researchers and literary executors to be able to afford to go back to communities to get the onerous permissions now being required by institutions. There is a real role for a grey archive where material can be kept safely, along with the metadata information needed in the future for contacting speakers. For instance, with our ACLA data, we need to know who’s in the recordings and any possible ways of contacting them, so that there is, in the future, the possibility of easily getting the permissions. However, that said, there are a number of recordings, like those made by Stephen Wurm, where we don’t necessarily even have the names of the people who’ve been recorded. But, again, that’s not a reason for not doing anything about digitising those tapes and hoping in the future to be able to find the speakers and only then digitise and archive the recordings. Imagine how one would feel if the last recording of your language, your ancestors’ language, had been trashed merely because people didn’t know who the speaker was.

So that whichever archive you go to, you know that you’re going to need to provide: the name of the speaker the name of the language the place recorded a permissions file for recording it any associated material, like a transcript. Bundling the material together is important, so you need to include that in the beginner’s guide too. But, one of the problems with AIATSIS, for instance, is that it doesn’t currently have a good way of linking a transcript and the audio file associated with the transcript.

A good dictionary is in effect a standardisation of the language, and it acts as a resource for community members wanting to revive or have literacy in their own language. Whereas, when you’ve got no publicly available dictionary, or a dictionary that only exists in paper form and is accessible to only a few people, then you tend to get people feeling worried about how to spell a language and arguing about it. This really delays having widespread knowledge of the language and widespread literacy. In the case of Wiradjuri, John Rudder and Stan Grant Senior produced a dictionary of the language. I think because of Stan Grant’s prestige in the community and his involvement in language reclamation courses, the dictionary got widely accepted and acts as a real force for helping people reclaim Wiradjuri. Similarly, the Kaurna dictionary has been a fantastic asset for the Kaurna community. It was published in 1840 by Teichelmann and Schürmann, reprinted by the Friends of the South Australian Library in the 1960s and made available in various forms, including a digitised copy which was put online. People have been able to take the original spelling system, and then develop a better one which uses pretty consistent spelling, so that you can recognise the same word on a street sign, in a place name and elsewhere. So, the public availability of that dictionary has helped Kaurna language revival. Figure 3: Pages 32 and 33 from ‘Outlines of a grammar, vocabulary, and phraseology of the Aboriginal language of South Australia, spoken by the natives in and for some distance around Adelaide’ by C.G. Teichelmann and C.W. Schürmann (1840). Image Source: Michael Treloar Antiquarian Booksellers, Adelaide You can contrast that with the Wagiman digital dictionary, developed by Stephen Wilson, which was put up on the AIATSIS website. Then AIATSIS, for some reason, decided it didn’t want to house electronic dictionaries. It was also put up on a Sydney University webpage, but the university went through one of its website changes and that webpage disappeared. So there were a number of years where you couldn’t find a copy of the Wagiman dictionary — as Aidan Wilson discussed in 2008. Now, Stephen has put it up on his own website for his laboratory in neuroscience, which is not exactly the place where you might expect to find a Wagiman dictionary.

Ideally, you don’t want a system like AIATSIS, where it takes a long time, like months and months and months, before anyone will be assigned to help you deposit the material or to accept a deposit. It also seems that library deposit forms are getting much more complex. Once upon a time, you could rock up in person to the National Library with a book that you wanted to donate and they would look at it and say, ‘Yeah,no’, or they’d say, ‘Yes’. Now, you have to go through a whole lot of hoops in order to give them a book, which you already know is not in their collection because you looked through their catalogue. What I do think is that it needs to be simple so that people are encouraged to put their material in an archive, and that could include a grey archive. We need to make it easy for people.

Kazuko and Grace were terrific in making sure that the metadata for the recordings was done with Luise insofar as they could, and kept with the files. Grace and I, as her executors, are left with her papers, which are very valuable but which were not at all organised, and also her digital files on different computers and laptops. So, there are field notebooks, offprints, just an enormous amount of stuff. Daniel Majchrzak, an honours student at ANU, has been slowly digitising the material that Grace and I thought was the highest priority, e.g. field notebooks, which he’s begun putting in Nyingarn. It will just stay in the Nyingarn workspace for a while, so again, that’s kind of a holding paddock. Once we’ve identified what the language is, then we have to identify the people who can talk for that language or the descendants of the person she recorded, in order to get permissions to make it public. These are massive tasks. It took us, I think, close to three months of a part-time research assistant just to catalogue the contents of the boxes of papers and books from Luise’s place, and that’s before even digitising them let alone tracking down the descendants of speakers for permissions. Figure 4: ANU student Daniel Majchrzak using a shelf-mounted digital camera for high-resolution image capture of the manuscripts of Luise Hercus. Image Source: Julia Colleen Miller Now that I’ve been a literary executor, I can see that you’ve got to think about your copyright, and the moral, intellectual and cultural property rights of the people you’ve recorded, and you have to name an executor in your will. Your literary executor needs to be able to produce a copy of that will in order to be able to do various things. You want someone as your literary executor who’s going to be able to deal with the mass of papers, recordings and computer files that you’ve created over your lifetime. The problem with computer files is that there’s a lot more of them, probably, than there are of your paper material. If they’re like mine, it’s going to be really difficult for an outsider to look at your computer hard drive and work out: what has been archived where? what is fresh? what are the final copies of papers that have been written? what are just backup versions that can be deleted? These are all things that would be really good to sort out. The Wenner-Gren Foundation actually has grants for anthropologists, in particular, to get their field recordings and material into shape for succession planning, which is a good idea. We are very grateful to Jane for making the time to talk with us about these important issues and we appreciate the insights she was able to provide, based on her experiences over her long and illustrious career. 1 Teresa Chan, Bridey Lea, Rosanna Smith and Simon Musgrave collaborated in editing this material. ↩ ","date":"2024-11-14","objectID":"/news/posts/jane-simpson/:5:0","tags":null,"title":"Interview with Jane Simpson","uri":"/news/posts/jane-simpson/"},{"categories":null,"content":"As detailed in an earlier post, we ran a Graduate Digital Research Fellowship (GDRF) program in 2023 under the auspices of the Australian Text Analytics Program (ATAP).

What’s more, the experience of working with a small team of dedicated scholars and mentors established a high quality academic environment and built long-lasting friendships that made this a truly inspiring and rewarding fellowship. Our mentors are exceptional in their academic and leadership abilities that build a team that will find longevity well beyond this initial experience. I highly recommend this program.

She used images and videos captured on a phone and then experimented with different image analysis algorithms to see which ones best identified greenery and its boundaries. The experiments showed that relatively simple approaches worked quite well, but further work is needed to decide whether the results will be useful for large scale surveys of urban environments.

One phenomenon which might relate to errors is pausing, and Quy was therefore interested to explore the possibilities of automatically identifying various characteristics of silent and filled pauses in recordings of speech, including their duration and placement within sentences. Building from this, he also looked at whether it was possible to automatically tag the start and end points of specific tasks within a controlled interaction (spoiler alert: not really).

I say officially because having worked on collaborative research projects and earning a PhD in Linguistics, within the context of an endangered language documentation collaborative project, I’ve been managing other people’s data, as well as my own, since I was a fledgling academic in the early 2000s. I am based at the Australian National University (ANU), and since mid-2023, I’ve been working as the senior data manager for the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA). Prior to this, I worked for the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL), who could offer a eight year data manager position, very generous in a field where contracts often last only two or three years. It was at CoEDL where I first took on this academic-adjacent role, focusing on bolstering research and research infrastructure. It was also the first time I had heard of such a position becoming available that addressed the data management and archiving needs of those actively recording or assembling cultural heritage data. Such data includes tabular data, text corpora, collections of songs and music, ethnographic interviews, elicited linguistic content, oral histories, traditional narratives and lexicons, and can be in different formats, such as text, video, audio, image, film, magnetic tape and digital files. The best part of this CoEDL role was that the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC), where I had been running the ANU unit since 2010, was going to be the main repository for CoEDL, and the two roles of archivist and data manager would be fundamentally intertwined.

This involved managing a continuous flow of enquiries from new and continuing researchers, offering guidance, and overseeing the entire data management and archiving processes. My aim was to ensure that valuable research data was preserved and made: accessible for future research available to the people and communities recorded, as well as to their descendants. Most days, in-person or over Zoom, I met with depositors to: guide them through the process of describing their data for their own research databases, making eventual archiving much easier discuss appropriate file formats find or create collaborative workspaces for CoEDL students, staff and their external collaborators develop data access protocols, refining conditions of access for archived collections offer file transfer options, ensuring secure data transmission inform researchers of other archiving alternatives if PARADISEC was not the best fit for their material. Over the years, I have tried to make the data management and archiving processes more efficient and helpful by creating archiving guides. Originally, these were static PDF files available on the CoEDL website; however, as they needed to be dynamic sources of information for rapidly changing technologies, they are now a series of webpages.

Typically, we archived these digital files in PARADISEC and shared links to new collections, or provided copies back to the Pacific Research Archives. A notable project involved digitising select items from the Helen Groger-Wurm collection at ANU. Helen Groger-Wurm, an anthropologist active in the 1960s, focused on Northern Australia, particularly Eastern Arnhem Land bark paintings. PARADISEC and CoEDL secured funding to digitise 26 audio tapes from this collection. This effort supported CoEDL PhD student Haoyi Li, who, due to COVID-19 restrictions, couldn’t conduct fieldwork in Arnhem Land when she was hoping to. Haoyi identified relevant items for her research, and we expanded the digitisation to include field notes alongside the audio tapes. This initiative enabled her to start her primary research remotely and gain valuable skills in archival engagement with legacy recordings, high-resolution image capture of field notes, open reel audio tape digitisation, metadata collection and archival record enrichment.

This blog post will hopefully offer some guidance by briefly providing some background information and addressing the common questions we receive about PIDs and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). ","date":"2024-07-03","objectID":"/news/posts/persistent-identifiers/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)","uri":"/news/posts/persistent-identifiers/"},{"categories":null,"content":"A brief overview of persistent identifiers Most of us are familiar with the concept of identifiers (IDs); they mark and individualise a person through life, from their name at birth through to IDs assigned at school, at work and in other contexts. Identifiers are needed for countless things in complex societies, e.g. material goods, documents and transactions, but the purpose remains the same: to unambiguously identify someone or something among similar others within a context. As far as we can see in the literature, the term PID is closely tied to the rise of the internet and digital information management in the 1990s. This makes sense as PIDs are meant to operate in the context of the web environment. The qualifier “persistent” refers to the need to mitigate effects of the transient nature of online content, where websites and digital resources can disappear, change or become inaccessible over time (Chapekis et al. 2024). PIDs are a critical part of scholarly communication, especially online where the volume of data is increasing every minute. Research outcomes and resources have to be shared appropriately, therefore, data objects and entities need to be unambiguously identifiable and reliably findable, and the connections between them made evident. PIDs are fundamental to fulfilling these requirements. The Australian Research Data Commons’s Australian National PID Strategy 2024 provides an excellent summary of how PIDs contribute to strengthening the digital infrastructure ecosystem and to driving research innovation in Australia. A strategy used by some PID systems (e.g. the DOI system) to sustain persistence is separating how the object is identified from where the object is located. The identification component consists of a globally unique identifier; a typical convention is as a series of numbers, letters and special characters. This identifier is optimised on the web by being actionable, that is, it can be formatted as a locator, e.g. a URL, that points to information or metadata about the object (also referred to as the reference to the object). Based on this strategy, an identifier is considered persistent when it consistently resolves over a reasonably long period to the webpage containing information or metadata about the object, including information about the location of the object. The location component is where the object is served or made available, whether on the web or in the physical world. Should the object location change, e.g. a data collection is moved to a different repository or becomes available through other websites, the relevant metadata on the reference page should reflect that fact. Note that although the reference is a digital description, it can be a description of any object or entity, whether digital, physical (e.g. scientific specimens, cultural heritage objects) or abstract (e.g. software, organisations). Understandably, PID systems on a global scale require large investments in robust technological infrastructures, including geographically distributed servers, digital preservation, and redirection and resolver systems. However, such infrastructure is useless without people and social structures to ensure that PIDs work as expected for as long as possible. Organisational commitment from stakeholders, including data owners, repository managers and PID registration agencies, are vital. Data stewards, for example, are responsible for obtaining PIDs for their datasets, creating rich and accurate metadata, ensuring changes to the metadata and the dataset are reflected in the PID registry, and adhering to data governance best practices, community standards and protocols. The PID landscape continues to evolve. If you are interested in delving deeper into persistence strategies used by different PID systems or nuanced views of identifier persistence from experts, see the Further Reading items below.

DOI stands for Digital Object Identifier, a PID which is in fact a digital identifier of an object, rather than an identifier of a digital object (DOI Key Facts). The DOI System was launched in 2000 by the International DOI Foundation (IDF), a not-for-profit organisation that functions as the governing body. DOI Registration Agencies (RAs) all over the world offer services for registering DOIs and community-specific metadata. University libraries and institutional research repositories can be members of an RA (e.g. DataCite in Australia) which allows them to create (or mint) and register DOIs for their organisation.

A review of the uptake of PID systems from the late 1990s to the late 2010s reported that DOIs are, for several good reasons, the most widely adopted PIDs in research data repository systems (Klump \u0026 Huber 2017). DOIs follow a standardised system: there is a syntax specification for the DOI name construction which is followed by all registrars, providing consistency across the board. The Handle System, a trusted and long-established digital infrastructure, is the DOI system’s resolution component providing reliability and persistence in the findability of research objects. Another notable characteristic of the DOI system is its well-developed social infrastructure. The IDF develops and enforces rules and policies for the maintenance of records and for managing the division of responsibilities between RAs, RA members and DOI users. As a consequence, DOIs promote good data governance practices. Apart from the act of obtaining a DOI, the associated responsibilities of creating and recording accurate and rich metadata, ensuring that the DOI record is updated through location and data changes, and providing clear data reuse and access terms, enlighten data owners and stewards about some of the practicalities of data governance. The DOI system’s underlying infrastructure supports interoperability across different platforms and systems. For example, DataCite’s “Add to ORCID Record” feature allows a researcher to manually claim a DOI of their work and link it to their ORCiD record (DataCite 2024). Data repositories can use DOIs to track usage metrics such as views, downloads and citations, which also informs data owners as to how researchers engage with the data. Below is a screenshot of a section of the DOI landing page for the La Trobe Corpus of Spoken Australian English with some of the key information highlighted and annotated. The DOI was issued by DataCite via the La Trobe University Library’s DOI service.

An RO-Crate Profile has (at least) a document that explains how metadata entities from the Schema are used for a particular purpose. An RO-Crate Mode is a set of lightweight syntactic rules for combining SOSS Classes, Properties and DefinedTerms, expressed in a JSON file.

This means that as long as your repository can handle a ZIP file it can take RO-Crates. RO-Crates enable data to travel with metadata. Beyond simply allowing the upload of opaque RO-Crates, there are opportunities for repository software to recognise metadata in an uploaded package and to pre-populate built-in metadata forms and/or datastores. This is not a pattern the authors have seen widely implemented in comprehensive institutionally focussed repositories, although at the time of writing it is being explored in Dataverse and InvenioRDM/Zenodo. We would encourage repository developers to explore this further, particularly those working with research data. RO-Crate support is increasing in research-domain repositories; e.g. RO-Crate upload with metadata extract is supported by WorkflowHub and ROHub). One of the design features of an RO-Crate is that as it can be “just a ZIP file” it can be used with any old repository that can handle ZIP files. The JSON file can also be uploaded separately. As RO-Crate adoption increases, the repository may be able to start to use the RO-Crate metadata it already has. You can/will have heard from Dieuwertje Bloemen here at OR2024 that DataVerse has support for RO-Crate metadata preview and building import/export mechanisms. The RO-Crate specification described a method of packaging data in a folder, which can be zipped, with any kind of file. This slide shows a folder of data, including a file with a typical obscure file name based on a timestamp (in this case created by a Dropbox upload from a digital camera). The RO-Crate Metadata file, in JSON Linked Data Format, can describe files. This one has a name (i.e. a title) for the file; “Cute puppy”. A human-readable description and preview (ro-crate-preview.html) can be in an HTML file that lives alongside the metadata. This slide shows an HTML view of the data that shows the image with its metadata, including the Schema.org name (equivalent to a Dublin Core title) for the file. Increasingly, research repository infrastructure is accepting RO-Crate input - this screenshot from WorkflowHub documents the upload API for submitting RO-Crate packaged descriptions of scientific workflows to the system. These can then be downloaded by others for reuse. Here, RO-Crate allows bypassing of the traditional “title, author, license, description” fields (rendered from the crate), as well as permitting user extensions on metadata to be kept in the repository.

RO-Crate solves this by specifying an extensible way to put linked-data metadata with data assets and to provide an HTML page or small website with the data to explain it. Thus data travels with its metadata and can be made human-readable. RO-Crate download is already available in many data repositories. Examples include: WorkflowHub: A registry for describing, sharing and publishing scientific computational workflows. ROHub: A repository of Earth Science datasets and computational methods. TLCMap: The Time Layered Cultural map is a set of tools that work together for mapping Australian history and culture. The Language Data Commons of Australia data portal: entirely built on RO-Crates, the underlying data consists of crates-on-disk and the API is based on RO-Crate metadata. Senckenberg Wildlive portal: exposes metadata about automatic photo captures of endangered animals using RO-Crate. Dataverse: at the time of writing, RO-Crate downloads are in development. We will encourage developers from other repository platforms to follow the Dataverse project’s lead and add RO-Crate support. This is a screenshot of the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Places – not exactly a repository but an example of a place where people can download datasets. This kind of download could be added to any repository system where there is at least one file that has metadata; offer a download ZIP option that has machine-readable JSON metadata (linked data in JSON-LD) and a human-readable summary of the metadata – this one has descriptions of a few files in it. Every repository implementer should add FAIR Signposting – just a couple of HTTP headers – this means machines can go from an HTML landing page to the actual download without guesswork – or even better – to an RO-Crate! I’m sure you’ll hear this mentioned in one of the talks by Herbert van de Sompel and colleagues, such as the one on FAIRiCat. Again, DataVerse is ahead of the curve and has already implemented this. As we mentioned above, data should travel with the metadata – one example of this from the WorkflowHub is how other services like the LifeMonitor retrieves the RO-Crate and then looks for custom annotations in the metadata to pick up and connect to the testing infrastructure. This was only possible because RO-Crate is extensible - you are not trapped with whatever 25 properties we’ve selected. The vessel is still RO-Crate, the repository didn’t need to add anything to support the LifeMonitor. One of the key benefits of linked-data metadata over previous ‘legacy’ approaches, is that multiple vocabularies can be combined into a single metadata document in a way that is not possible with, say MARC, or MODS XML, and that all these vocabularies can use the same syntax and approach to describing data. This means that a simple generic RO-Crate viewer can be used to visualise any metadata whether it is basic “Who, What, Where” metadata (like Dublin Core) or domain-specific metadata like the RO-Crate metadata profile (https://w3id.org/ldac/profile) used by the Language Data Commons of Australia. This can be displayed alongside the core RO-Crate metadata without any expensive configuration or coding. If the recommendations are followed, the RO-Crate metadata terms are self-documenting, e.g. all the Language Data Commons terms which use a Schema.org Style approach, are defined here: https://w3id.org/ldac/terms. This slide is a repeat of one we used last year – this screenshot is a bit of (undated) DSpace documentation found following a tip from Kim Sheppard – we have included it here to illustrate that storing additional metadata (in this case METS) for an object was done by convention – it had to be stored in a special file called METS.xml.

Tools are designed to work in low-resource environments, allowing communities to have agency and control over their materials. We prioritise sustainability, simplicity, standardisation, linked-data description and clear licensing over user interface features, in line with Suleman’s keynote presentation at OR2023, while still being able to drive rich, full-featured services when resources allow and fall back to a sustainable core if needed. Much of the data we work with is subject to Indigenous Cultural Intellectual Property (ICIP) rights, controlled by First Nations peoples guided by Indigenous data sovereignty principles; we must ensure it is handled in a conscionable and culturally responsible manner. Making data Accessible does not always mean Open Access – under both research ethics and the CARE and FAIR principles, data by and about humans needs access control and licensing. Our framework deals with these issues and is built from the ground up to be “as open as possible, as closed as needed”. NOTE: Since the abstract was submitted we have adopted the name “Protocols” for the use in work we are doing on tools for FAIR and CARE adoption. This slide summarises the aims of the Language Data Commons of Australia project. The area of the strategy we’re focusing on for this presentation is highlighted – tools, standards and technical infrastructure. The activities we are undertaking are: Develop shared tools, standards and technical infrastructure to help data stewards care for data for the long term Build data portals with useful search functions and lightweight technical structures. Towards the following outcomes: Standards and tools are available and being applied by data stewards Good governance and standardised, distributed storage of data helps preserve data Discovering and locating language data is easy via linked portals. We don’t need to define the term “Repository” at the Open Repositories conference, but we do need to define a term that we use at LDaCA when we talk about Repositories – we use the inclusive term “Archival Repository” to refer to systems designed to keep data for the long term. We do this to avoid drawing boundaries around what is a “repository” vs an “archive” or a Digital Preservation system and to include as many practitioners as possible in the conversation. The first implementation of this stream of work was the UTS Research Data Portal – this has not been updated for a while due to staffing changes at the university and a lack of ongoing governance that made the data repository dependent on individual people (three of whom are authors of this paper and no longer work for UTS), but as of mid-2024 it is being renovated and revitalised. This screenshot shows what an LDaCA site looks like; a typical data-discovery portal. Underneath is not a typical (by Open Repositories standards) repository solution like Dspace, Innvenio or EPrints, all of which are more or less monolithic architectures.

Making language resources and materials sustainable and accessible is central to the work of LDaCA. This includes working in collaboration with communities, and providing them with the tools and support they need to be effective custodians of their language materials. The sub-theme has six components (Voices of Country p34): Embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural practices and knowledge systems into linguistic methodologies. Develop resources that document and record languages, such as dictionaries, encyclopaedias, thesauri, grammar and orthography documents. Record and digitise written and oral language collections, resources and materials. Provide communities with the support, training and infrastructure they require to build language resources and collections. Support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to access and repurpose historical language materials. Repatriate language materials and cultural knowledge to community ownership and control. We will give a brief summary of how LDaCA is contributing to each of these areas of activity, first covering components two to six and then returning to show how all of those activities contribute to the first component. In this summary, we will refer occasionally to the FAIR and CARE ethical research principles which are core to our work. The FAIR principles have been developed as a foundation for good, scholarly ways of finding and using data, providing key guideposts (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for transparent, reproducible, and reusable language research. Further key principles for advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination, CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics), guide ethical work with Indigenous language collections.

LDaCA has developed policies and technical solutions for implementing such access controls that make ongoing administration of access as straightforward as possible. We are sharing ideas and solutions with our colleagues in the Indigenous stream of the HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons.

When working with language material, LDaCA is guided by FAIR and CARE principles (Carroll et al. 2020; Carroll et al. 2021; Wilkinson et al. 2016). The FAIR principles provide guidance on ensuring that data will be useful in the future, though they do this from a Western scientific perspective. The CARE principles extend the FAIR data management principles and we hope that our commitment to these principles assists us in contributing to the goals of the Voices of Country plan: Making data more sustainable and more informed by Indigenous knowledges helps ensure that Indigenous communities benefit from the data. Providing accessible solutions for access management contributes to First Nations people’s authority to control Indigenous data. Supporting Indigenous communities in developing data capabilities helps to build positive relationships and show responsibility in our work with Indigenous Peoples. Basing all of our work on ethical principles respects the rights and well-being of Indigenous Peoples. We see all of our activities as both being guided by the CARE principles, and as contributing to the overall aim of embedding Indigenous knowledges and cultural practices into our methodologies. Indigenous control of access to data, Indigenous perspectives made part of the description of data, and using Indigenous perspectives to make data more accessible to communities are all part of this endeavour.

We then focused on the research project for the remainder of the course.

Certain friends, who had grown up in south-west Sydney and were mostly from a Vietnamese background, were prone to using the expression and whatnot, something that I never said myself. Researching this phenomenon revealed that it was a discourse-pragmatic feature called a general extender (GE). Figure 1: Two people using general extenders (GEs) in a conversation Image Source: Teresa Chan GEs are phrase-final expressions such as and stuff and or whatever that prototypically ’extend’ the referent of a phrase by evoking a more general set of items to which it belongs. They serve a range of discourse and interpersonal functions, such as hedging, establishing solidarity or marking in-group affiliation (Norrby \u0026 Winter, 2002). Regional and social variation in the use of GEs has been found across spoken and written English, including Australian English (Travis, Grama \u0026 Gonzalez, 2017), with different patterns of usage depending on variables like age, gender and socio-economic class. However, at the time of the project, ethnicity had rarely been considered (e.g. Secova, 2017), despite the fact that the high frequency of a specific GE form in a region can make it a statistical “marker of ethnic identity” (Aijmer, 2013, p. 146). There was also only one study on GEs in computer-mediated communication (CMC) (Fernandez \u0026 Yuldashev, 2011). Additionally, although GE usage in Australian English had been compared to its usage in varieties of English spoken in other countries, no research had looked at usage across different cities within Australia. My project would attempt to fill these gaps in the literature and explore socio-regional variation in GE usage in spoken and CMC settings. “Socio-regional” refers to the stratification of socio-economic class by region (Sheard, 2019, p. 486). The research questions I would aim to address were: Are there differences in GE usage in Australia between: a. different cities? b. different ethnicities? Does GE usage differ between spoken settings and CMC settings in Australia? Do the results corroborate or refute previous findings, particularly those for Australian English?

For the spoken language component, I could not construct my own corpus of recordings without requiring a potentially lengthy ethics clearance process, and so would need to rely on existing datasets like AusTalk and Sydney Speaks. For the CMC component, I needed to create my own dataset, which was reliant on both the suitability of the data source for my purposes and the skills required to access the data. Previous studies have found linguistic differences by geographical location within the same country on X (e.g. Rechkemmer, Wilson \u0026 Mihalcea, 2020), making it an appropriate choice for a CMC site. Furthermore, the website had an advanced search engine that allowed you to search for geolocated posts. X was also compatible with commercial web scraping software, allowing me to compensate for my lack of knowledge and experience as a novice researcher whose only relevant capability was a rudimentary knowledge of Python.

The spoken corpora must already have transcriptions of the recordings available and the metadata needed to contain fields that matched the variables I was looking for. A small portion of the recordings in the AusTalk dataset had already been transcribed and made available online. This data could be downloaded from two separate (now defunct) web-based tools: the transcriptions via the Alveo website and the metadata via the Alveo Query Engine. The metadata contained detailed demographic information about the speakers in the recordings, allowing me to operationalise different fields into my chosen variables: age, gender, socio-economic class (education level), ethnicity (cultural heritage) and geographical location (current city). For the Sydney Speaks corpus, I submitted an application for access to the main researcher, LDaCA Chief Investigator Catherine Travis, and once granted, she sent me a link to download the data files. The metadata was encoded in the file names, with different codes used for ethnicity, gender and age. Luckily for future researchers, the majority of the Sydney Speaks corpus will be incorporated into the LDaCA portal, where the data and metadata will be made FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Aside from the metadata requiring more manual work to extract, the utility of the Sydney Speaks dataset was lower than AusTalk for three main reasons: Only a limited number of ethnicities were included: Anglo (Australian), Chinese, Greek and Italian. The data was collected solely in Sydney, meaning it could only be analysed for a single geographical location. No metadata field was available to operationalise into a class variable. The accessibility of data and metadata from the CMC source was also key. Posts on X were highly accessible compared to other CMC sites, such as Facebook, where posts could be hidden from those outside of the user’s social network. However, the reverse was true when looking for information about a user on X, as usernames, user profiles and profile pictures were less likely to reflect the user’s true identity compared to Facebook. As a result, the metadata was sparser, and aside from geographical location, only one other variable was operationalised: gender. I assigned a gender to each user based on their username and handle, consulting profile pictures and descriptions in ambiguous cases (see Figure 2 for examples). While being arguably limited in making such a determination, this method was the most suitable option available at the time. If I wanted more reliable user information, ethics clearance would be needed, as it was only possible to determine all variables conclusively by contacting the users.

In previous studies, the frequency of GE usage across major varieties of English ranged from about 20 to 40 GEs per 10,000 words of speech, though rates of 50 to 60 GEs per 10,000 words had been observed among adolescents (Cheshire, 2007; Norrby \u0026 Winter, 2002). See Figure 1 for the rates of use of GEs (per 10,000 words) by age across several of these studies. Figure 3: Rates of use of GEs (per 10,000 words) by age, across studies Image Source: Catherine Travis These studies looked at spoken language, as the prevalence of GEs was found to be higher in spoken corpora compared to written corpora. Indeed, one study (Martínez, 2011) found the frequency of GEs was approximately 9 to 10 per 10,000 words in the spoken subcorpus compared to 1 to 1.5 in the written subcorpus of two different corpora of British English (International Corpus of English-GB component and the British National Corpus). Additionally, in the written subcorpora, GEs were mainly found in fictional dialogue or conversation, or in informal writing, such as emails. This evidences the fact that GEs appear to be predominantly features of spoken language. Based on the frequency figures outlined above, datasets needed to contain hundreds of thousands of words of speech in order to produce a sufficient number of GE tokens. Both AusTalk and Sydney Speaks featured spoken language and proved to be large enough datasets (274,676 words and 568,555 words, respectively). For the AusTalk corpus, participants completed a number of different tasks, but only data from two of the tasks were considered for the dataset: a story re-telling task, where a participant was asked to re-tell a story from a previous task in their own words, and an interview task, where the participant and researcher discussed a topic of interest to the participant. These tasks were designed to elicit a more spontaneous speech style, which would be fruitful ground to find GEs. Although interactions on CMC sites generally feature more written than spoken language, they seem more like oral interactions than written interactions. In a study on a synchronous CMC site (instant messaging), Fernandez and Yuldashev (2011) found GE usage patterns were closer to those used in spoken interaction rather than written interaction, though the frequency of occurrence was noticeably lower compared to the spoken corpora they investigated. I theorised an asynchronous CMC site like X should also demonstrate usage patterns that were similar to spoken interaction.

Different cities? There were no statistically significant differences in frequency of GE usage between different Australian cities in AusTalk. However, the Sydney Speaks mean frequency per 10,000 words was significantly higher than the mean frequencies of the other cities in AusTalk, including Sydney1. Looking at GE categories, there were no statistically significant results. However, there were apparent trends, such as Sydney AusTalk speakers using less common variants more often compared to other cities2. Thus, there is some evidence of linguistic differences by geographical location. b. Different ethnicities? There were no statistically significant differences in frequency of usage between Anglo and non-Anglo Australians within both spoken corpora. However, when the corpora were compared, the mean frequency of both Anglo and non-Anglo Australians in Sydney Speaks was significantly higher than that of both Anglo and non-Anglo Australians in AusTalk3. There were no statistically significant differences in preferred variants, though there were some evident trends. For instance, Chinese Australians in the Sydney Speaks dataset used whatnot/what not variants more often than other ethnicities4, which might relate to my original observation about Vietnamese Australians. Does GE usage differ between spoken settings and CMC settings in Australia? There were more GE tokens on X than in the spoken corpora. However, the mean frequency per user was significantly lower on X than the mean frequency per speaker in the spoken corpora5, likely due to the limitation in post lengths on X. Figure 3 illustrates the mean GE frequency for Sydney speakers in the AusTalk and Sydney Speaks datasets compared to X users6. There were also GE variants such as (and) stuff (like that) that were used significantly more frequently by speakers in the spoken corpora than by X users7. Therefore, it seems usage patterns on X differ from those in spoken Australian English. Figure 5: Mean GE frequency for Sydney speakers in AusTalk and Sydney Speaks datasets compared to X (formerly Twitter) Image Source: Teresa Chan Do the results corroborate or refute previous findings, particularly those specific to Australian English? The AusTalk results corroborated the robust finding on age (e.g. Secova, 2017; Travis et al., 2017), that is, younger speakers used GEs more frequently than older speakers8. There was also support across both corpora for previous studies that found no gender and class differences in frequency of usage.

I considered expanding on this in a PhD degree, but decided against pursuing this, before I ended up working at LDaCA. If I do resume my research, I would need to consider other CMC sites, with X on the decline and no clear winner among the alternatives. However, other large platforms like Reddit and Facebook come with their own challenges, including restrictions in access to their underlying APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Using the APIs would allow me to avoid web scraping and its associated risks (e.g. potential violation of website terms) and limitations (e.g. difficulty in handling large or complex websites). Additionally, I would drastically change how I approach data capture and analysis, with a focus on digital automation and open-source software. The LDaCA portal would also be an invaluable resource to locate corpora of Australian English, with a clear and straightforward path in accessing both the data and associated metadata.

We would like to thank Chief Investigator Louisa Willoughby for first letting us know about Kalin’s work, and Kalin for graciously agreeing to the interview and providing his thoughts. Kalin Stefanov, Monash University Image Source: Kalin Stefanov How did you get interested in sign language? During my PhD at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, I worked on a project that aimed at creating a learning environment where children can learn signs in a game-like setting. An on-screen avatar presents the signs and gives the child certain tasks to accomplish, and in doing so, the child gets to practise the signs. The system was thus required to interpret the signs produced by the child, distinguish them from other signs, and indicate whether or not it was the right one. For this project, I developed a real-time hand gesture recognition technology applied to the recognition of Swedish Sign Language signs. To date, this is the only real-time Swedish Sign Language recogniser and one of the few such technologies in the world (both in academia and industry). The project involved close collaboration with researchers (native signers) at the Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University and technology evaluation with the target end-users. This was my (immersed) introduction to the fascinating world of sign language communication and since then I have participated in a range of research projects related to different sign language technologies. Can you tell us about the project you are currently undertaking? My current project addresses the computational modelling of Auslan. The project expects to generate knowledge by creating the largest Auslan dataset, enabling further advancements in this research area. The dataset will also play an essential role in other research fields, e.g. sign linguistics. Expected outcomes include the invention of the first Auslan recogniser and generator, representing a substantial advancement towards fully automated Auslan translation. The Auslan recogniser will be able to distinguish 1000+ isolated Auslan signs. This means that by providing a video of an isolated Auslan sign, the recogniser will ‘translate’ it to written or spoken English. We also aim to provide mechanisms for personalisation of the recogniser to account for individual variations in signing. The Auslan generator will operate in the reverse direction and be able to synthesise 1000+ isolated Auslan signs. This means that by providing a written or spoken English word, the generator will ‘translate’ it to a video of an isolated Auslan sign. We also aim to provide mechanisms for the personalisation of the generator to account for individual preferences in appearance and signing style. Who will be helped by the output of your project, and how? The Auslan recogniser and generator will be general enough to form the core of many applications targeted at specific needs. I see at least two contexts that could benefit directly from the project outcomes: Auslan education and research. In education, on the one hand, I can envision an application for individual Auslan sign acquisition and training (think ‘Duolingo for Auslan’). On the other hand, in collaboration with A/Prof Louisa Willoughby and her extensive network, we will attempt to co-design more focused pedagogical applications of the technologies. We are still in the early stages of the technology development, hence we have not yet finalised what this could look like. One possible direction is to embed the developed technologies in education offerings for future Auslan interpreters. This will potentially improve the quality of Auslan training and ensure that more students pass interpreting exams and enter the workforce as confident Auslan interpreters.

During my time at Appen, a significant part of my work involved a diverse range of projects for both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, including phonetic transcription, grapheme-to-phoneme or letter-to-sound (L2S) rule development, and part-of-speech (POS) annotation. To break down these language technologies further, ASR enables computers to process human spoken language into readable text, allowing users to operate devices through speech or facilitate translation of that speech into other languages. Conversely, TTS generates an audio version of a written text. TTS can be used to improve accessibility, particularly for those with vision impairments or learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Language technology relies heavily on good-quality data, and the table below illustrates just some of the processes used in Appen projects, with use cases they can be applied to. Process Type Description Example Use Case Phonetic Transcription The process of transcribing words in a lexicon according to their sound (pronunciation lexicon), through the use of a phonetic alphabet such as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) or X-SAMPA (a phonetic script that uses symbols all found on a standard keyboard, aiding in native-speaker transcription). Suprasegmental features such as stress, tone, vowel length, pitch accent and syllabification can also be encoded where relevant to the language. Use in ASR: Appen developed language packs in 26 languages for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Babel program, facilitating improvement in speech recognition performance for languages other than English which have very little transcribed data. These projects generally have data collection, orthographic transcription and phonetic transcription components, the latter using X-SAMPA annotation. Further reading: IARPA - Babel Example dataset: IARPA Babel Mongolian Language Pack Use in TTS: In collaboration with health service providers GuildLink and MedAdvisor, Appen produces TTS audio of Australian Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) documents. This audio is available at medsinfo. Further reading: GuildLink Makes Consumer Medicines Information More Accessible Grapheme-to-Phoneme or Letter-to-Sound (L2S) Rule Development A set of rules for a given language that map between orthography and pronunciation, used to generate phonetic transcriptions from an input text. These rules can be both single and multi-letter mappings such as orthographic \u003cs\u003e → X-SAMPA /s/ and \u003csh\u003e → /S/ in English. The rules can refer to the surrounding environment which allows for alternative phonetic mappings based on the characters’ position in a word, surrounding morphemes, or other linguistic processes that impact pronunciation. For example, rules are implemented to specify when \u003cs\u003e should be pronounced as /z/ as in ‘roses’ or as /s/ as in ‘sit’. Suprasegmental features such as stress, tone, vowel length, pitch accent and syllabification may also be encoded, however, the accuracy of these in the output pronunciations depends on the given language and the extent to which these features are predictable from orthography alone. As was the case for the IARPA Babel program, one of the first steps in producing pronunciation lexicons involves running the wordlist through a language or dialect-specific L2S algorithm to generate hypothesised X-SAMPA pronunciations of each word. For many of the 26 languages in Babel, these rules didn’t yet exist and had to be developed through research, consultation and iterative testing with native speaker linguists. The automated output is then checked and edited as needed by native speaker linguists. L2S rules may be further developed according to customised requirements, for example, additiona","date":"2024-03-22","objectID":"/resources/general-resources/case-studies/data-mangement-appen/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Data Management in Language Technology: A Case Study of Appen","uri":"/resources/general-resources/case-studies/data-mangement-appen/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Data Management during the Life of a Project Due to the variety of services, data types and customisation capabilities provided by Appen, it is difficult to present a single standard approach to data management. Instead, I’ll focus on the processes that were developed for datasets that have both orthographic and phonetic transcription components, also known as transcription and lexicon multi-component projects. The basic procedure for these projects is outlined below: The client or project sponsor specifies the parameters for the dataset and its collection in consultation with Appen specialists. Appen carries out data collection, usually in the form of conversational or scripted telephony, VoIP or microphone recordings with qualified participants from Appen’s crowd of more than a million. Conversational data refers to spontaneous or unscripted natural speech on a variety of topics either over the telephone or with both participants in the same room, while for scripted data, participants read and respond to a set text of prompts, curated to facilitate topic, domain, keywords, key phrases and phonetic coverage. All participants are provided with a consent form explaining the purpose of the collection and how the data will be used, and only take part in the collection if they are happy and comfortable to do so, and if they sign the consent form. Personal data such as names are anonymised and sensitive personal data is not collected. The audio data is then quality-checked to ensure it meets the requirements for the collection, including demographic balance, language and content, background noise levels, audio levels and recording duration. The approved audio goes through some pre-processing steps to batch the data into smaller segments, then is orthographically transcribed by the transcription (TX) team. Timestamps are checked at this stage as well to ensure correct alignment of the audio and the transcribed text, and a variety of labels are added to capture speaker and non-speaker noise events (e.g. laugh, cough, background noise). Rigorous quality assurance processes are applied while the transcription is ongoing and on the resulting complete data set. Figure 1: Example of audio with transcription, batched and presented to transcribers in tool. Image Source: Appen Figure 2: Example of the resulting transcription text file. Image Source: Appen A sorted list of unique word forms (e.g. ‘house’, ‘houses’) occurring in the dataset is created from the orthographically transcribed data and sent to the lexicon (LX) team, who work with a group of native speaker linguists to prepare phonetic transcriptions of the words, either in X-SAMPA or another phonetic script. If a POS lexicon is also required for the dataset, this is similarly created from the sorted list of unique word forms and checked by native speaker linguists. Figure 3: Example of a Hungarian pronunciation lexicon loaded to the transcription tool for native speaker review. Image Source: Appen Figure 4: Example of a UK English pronunciation lexicon. Image Source: Appen Figure 5: Example of a UK English POS lexicon. Image Source: Appen Data across each stage is validated for quality assurance. The audio, transcription and lexicon(s) are packaged for delivery. As shown above, the data for a single project goes through multiple stages of annotation and requires specialist linguist expertise in the data management process before each part can be combined for final delivery. One major challenge in this process is dealing with errors and inconsistencies that arise both prior to, and during, the validation stage, particularly where data is shared between the TX and LX teams. As transcribers and linguists prepare the annotations, variations may arise in features like spelling, capitalisation and punctuation. Languages may have no or multiple accepted orthographic conventions, and a standard approach must be determined for the project and adhered to.

Image Source: Appen At the time of writing, Appen has over 280 audio, image, video and text datasets in over 80 languages available as pre-labeled datasets. These datasets are publicly accessible and can be filtered according to several categories: product type, common use cases, language and number of hours of audio, word or image count, if applicable (called Unit in the table below). Combined with a standard search function, this filtering allows interested parties to further refine their query for data most applicable to their needs.

Additional details appear in a pop-up window when you click on the “tile” for a given dataset. For example: Catalogue entries for a Danish POS dataset and a Mongolian pronunciation dictionary: Figure 7: Danish POS dictionary catalogue summary and metadata. Image Source: Appen Figure 8: Mongolian pronunciation dictionary catalogue summary and metadata. Image Source: Appen This is a helpful starting point for browsing and refining the dataset selection, but in order to find the most suitable match, clients consult directly with Appen to discuss their language technology needs in full. More detailed metadata for each dataset is tracked internally and this is used to further assist with client queries and requests. Some of the additional metadata categories recorded include the demographics of the contributors for each dataset, such as the age range and gender distribution of the participants, the dialect coverage within a specific language, the year of collection, and the domains or topics discussed in the collection. Using the metadata as filters, requests can be divided into three alternative outcomes: Dataset(s) matching all requirements are available and a sample of the data is shared with the client to confirm this is the case. Dataset(s) matching only some of the requirements are available and samples of these are shared in case they are still applicable to the project. No dataset matching the requirements is available and a quote is then prepared for producing a new dataset ​​or enhancing an existing dataset. In terms of dataset storage, collections are catalogued first according to language and second by dataset type. This method works particularly well for pre-labeled datasets, because, if nothing else, clients usually know which language(s) they want data for and other specifics can follow from there.

Two main issues that are important to consider for data collections are: Ensuring that collections with multiple component parts are organised in such a way that updates can be applied to the whole, rather than introducing inconsistencies between related data. Determining the parties that will be using the repository and assuring that the methods of accessing data are intuitive for all groups. These issues are handled in the Appen workflow through the use of iterative semi-automated spelling checks and other similar processes which enable modifications to be integrated into all levels of the dataset, and through clear recording and accessibility of the metadata describing a collection, available both to Appen staff and its clients. For LDaCA, these issues are of equal importance for wider data management. To the first point, while it is ultimately the responsibility and prerogative of the data contributor to decide how their data should be organised, LDaCA can also assist with this process. Guidance is available on best practices for data management and organisation of metadata, both in the form of the documentation available at LDaCA Resources, as well as automated validation of metadata category requirements for datasets added and edited through Crate-O. To the second point, LDaCA has a responsibility to ensure that tools to facilitate data management and discoverability are accessible and intuitive for all, including the portals that use the Oni application to access data packaged as RO-Crates. This should be an iterative process, with further improvements to operability implemented based on user feedback and needs.

Important aims and motivations of the LDaCA project are to secure language data in Australia and to make it easily available to researchers (and other interested parties). But language researchers have been aware of these issues for some time and the AusNC was an earlier attempt to address them. The AusNC was discussed in various places before the work of assembling data began. A meeting of interested people was held at the conferences of the Australian Linguistic Society and the Applied Linguistics Association of Australia in 2008, and a workshop was held in 2008 (proceedings published in Haugh et al. 2009), supported by an ARC-funded network for research into speech and communication (HSC-Net). Following these meetings, funding support from the Australian National Data Service, and subsequent funding and technical support from Griffith University enabled us to start the AusNC project, which was led by Michael Haugh, then a staff member at Griffith. Several data sets, which already existed and could easily be accessed, were included in this initial stage of the project: AustLit (selected samples of out-of-copyright poetry, fiction and criticism ranging from 1795 to the 1930s) The Australian Corpus of English (ACE) The Australian component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-AUS) Australian Radio Talkback (ART) The Corpus of Oz Early English (COOEE) The Monash Corpus of English (MCE) The Griffith Corpus of Spoken Australian English (GCSAusE) Braided Channels (oral histories of women from the Channel Country) Mitchell and Delbridge (a sample from data collected around 1960 documenting the speech of Australian adolescents) The team behind the AusNC always hoped that additional data would be added to the corpus, although funding constraints meant that only one further collection, the La Trobe Corpus of Spoken English, was added to the corpus shortly after the initial launch of the AusNC web interface. The Griffith University eResearch Services built the web interface and hosted the data for the AusNC, which was launched in 2012. From 2014, the Alveo virtual laboratory also held a copy of the data and provided alternative ways of interacting with it. However, after the launch of the Alveo version, the Griffith version of the corpus changed in various ways, and the two versions remained out of sync for a time, before both eventually became inaccessible when changes in the underlying technologies meant that maintaining those digital infrastructures was no longer cost effective. The Alveo virtual laboratory still exists, in principle, but has not been regularly maintained since 2019, and its services are rarely operational. With no ongoing funding and no staff member affiliated with the AusNC project, Griffith University indicated that it could not maintain the AusNC data sets and interface, and closed those facilities when the data was transferred to LDaCA in 2023.1 All the original data sets are now available (or are in the process of being made available) through the LDaCA data portal, and in one case, there is a substantial increase in the amount of data available (see discussion of Mitchell and Delbridge below).

An example of such a corpus in the AusNC is the Mitchell and Delbridge dataset. Mitchell and Delbridge wanted to know what Australian speech sounded like, how it differed from other varieties of English (often Received Pronunciation), and what sort of variation occurred within the Australian community. To answer these questions, Mitchell and Delbridge recruited school principals across the country to organise recordings of adolescents reading word lists and other prepared material, with a small, less structured component. As mentioned above, the AusNC made only a small part of this dataset available. LDaCA is delighted that, with the assistance of the University of Sydney, we are now able to provide access to data from all of the 7,736 speakers from 330 schools who were recorded. Another example of such a corpus in the AusNC is the Braided Channels collection, which contains 70 hours of oral history interviews with women from Queensland’s Channel Country. This is an example of a collection that was created to answer historical and cultural questions, but has been repurposed to enable researchers to address linguistic questions as well.

The kinds of material and the relative amounts of different kinds of material are decided in advance, and then data is collected accordingly. We can distinguish two sub-types within this category: the plan already exists or the plan needs to be developed independently. Existing plan In some cases, data is collected according to the plan of another corpus which already exists, so that meaningful comparisons can be made. An example of this approach in the AusNC is the Australian Corpus of English (ACE), which was designed to be comparable with two previous corpora: the Brown Corpus of American English and the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus of UK English (which was itself designed to be comparable with the Brown Corpus). The Australian component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-AUS) is another example of this type of corpus in the AusNC. Independent plan Alternatively, a corpus can be designed independently, but with the intention that it should be representative of some realm of language use, showing different genres and registers, and possibly also sampling some aspects of demographic variation. A classic example of such a corpus is the British National Corpus (BNC: 1994 version, 2014 version), which includes samples of both written and spoken language, with different kinds of written text in specified proportions, and which samples speaker variation across dimensions such as geography, gender and age. The BNC is sometimes referred to as a ‘reference corpus’; the idea is that it provides a baseline against which phenomena from other datasets can be compared. COOEE was constructed on similar, if less ambitious, lines. The corpus is divided into four time periods, with an approximately equal amount of material in each. Texts are assigned to one of four different types, and the proportion of each of those types is approximately equal in each time period. Such a design makes it easy to examine chronological change or variation between registers.

Again, we can distinguish some sub-types here. Restricted amount of data Sometimes, opportunistic data collection is the only viable strategy. An example of this is the approach often taken by linguists documenting languages whose future is uncertain. In that situation, carefully planning what kinds of data to collect and in what proportions would be ideal, but is typically a luxury which cannot be afforded. Collecting anything which is easily available is at least a good starting point — if one becomes aware that there are large gaps in the data collected, one can try to address the problem in the future, but that may not ever be possible. This type of corpus is the result of making the best one can of limited opportunities, which restrict the amount of data which is available. Collections of spoken interaction are often assembled in this way. The Griffith Corpus of Spoken Australian English (GCSAusE), which includes recordings made and transcribed by students, is an example of this type of corpus in the AusNC. Extensive data Opportunistic data collection is also relevant to big data: many researchers work with data from the web nowadays, and this almost inevitably involves opportunistic procedures. However, in this case, the large amount of data which is accessible can justify a claim that a significant part of the variation occurring in language use (at least for a certain type of use) will be represented in the data. On this basis, many linguists are happy to use a corpus of web data, at least for exploratory research. Figure 2: The Australian National Corpus logo.

The AusNC calls itself a corpus, so can we assign it to one of these types? We hope that the answer to this question is clear: the AusNC was an opportunistic collection. When the possibility of a corpus was being discussed, there were proposals for it to be carefully planned. For example, in a paper published following one of the workshops leading up to the AusNC, Pho (2009) argued that an Australian corpus should mirror the design of the BNC. However, even putting together a collection of written material on the scale of the BNC is a huge task, never mind the spoken language component; the BNC itself was produced by a large team working over a number of years. The AusNC project never enjoyed a level of funding which would have made such a plan possible (indeed, the amount of funding we received while very welcome was modest). In these circumstances, we had no alternative but to create the AusNC from existing data sources which custodians were prepared to share. We did hope that this model would make it easy to expand the corpus, but this did not occur, as we were not able to develop the infrastructure necessary for ongoing expansion of the corpus with the limited amount of funding we had. In 2012, it seemed obvious that the appropriate term for our project was corpus. We were putting together a collection of language data and it came to exist as an entity in its own right. What was included might be the result of rather random factors, but there was a coherence in that all the data related to language use, in fact, use of the English language in Australia. No one was talking about ‘data commons’2 when the AusNC was created (or we were not listening). If the concept had been actively discussed, perhaps we would have described what we were doing as a data commons. The inception of LDaCA coincided, more or less, with the two factors mentioned above which led to the AusNC becoming non-viable: the understandable withdrawal of support from Griffith University and the instability of the Alveo infrastructure due to funding constraints. It was therefore inevitable that transferring the AusNC collection to the new project would be an early priority. Approaching this task, we faced the problem of whether it still made sense to refer to the collection of datasets as the AusNC. After discussion within our project, and with the custodians of the AusNC datasets, we decided that retaining the name would suggest a coherence which did not exist now that the AusNC was part of LDaCA. The AusNC is now part of a larger assemblage of collections of data, and we felt that any internal coherence which the AusNC might have did not differentiate it, or the datasets it was composed of, from that broader landscape. Therefore, we made the decision to include the component datasets of the AusNC as separate collections in LDaCA data portal. The top-level description of each of the collections contains the following sentence to acknowledge the history of the data: “This collection was previously accessible online via the Australian National Corpus (AusNC), an initiative managed by Griffith University between 2012 and 2023.” Additionally, this blog post is available to those who are interested in the history of the AusNC.3 The corpus is dead, long live the data commons!

Clearly, the search function in a word processor is not going to find this as an instance of the word deal! Eve’s project looked at the possibility of developing code in a Jupyter notebook which could identify base word forms in such transcriptions and allow the researcher to see all instances of a word in an interaction.

For my postgraduate research, I documented and described grammatical topics of Sudest (known as Vanga Vanatɨna by its speakers), an Oceanic language spoken in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The language is spoken on the islands of Vanatinai (also known as Sudest and Tagula) and Yeina in the Louisiade Archipelago, approximately 350 kilometres southeast of the PNG mainland. In the following, I discuss decisions I made and processes I followed related to the collection of language data and archiving the resulting corpus of texts, including ethical considerations, ownership of the data, data formats, metadata, and data security and reuse. This is by no means meant as a guide (of best practice) for projects where language data are being collected with speakers of un(der)described languages. Rather, it is an account of some of the types of considerations and procedures that need to be considered when collecting language data and how I handled them in this instance. Map of Louisiade Archipelago Image Source: Harriet Sheppard Before recording with a speaker for the first time, I would explain the project to the speaker and their rights as contributors to the project. I would explain how I would use the language recordings, how they would be stored and accessed and how speakers of the language or other researchers might access and use the recordings in the future. This included discussing how they, the person(s) making the recording, would retain ownership over the recording (i.e. intellectual and cultural property rights). They would also be the ones to choose access rights over the text and have the option to withdraw any or all recordings they made from the corpus at any point (more on these below). After these discussions, if the speaker was still interested in the project, I would then record an oral consent form with them. The consent form was in English, the language of wider communication in the province. In cases where the speaker didn’t speak or spoke limited English, we would have a translator present for this process. I chose to use an oral consent form as it is accessible to all participants no matter their literacy levels. It also has the advantage of being a more durable format compared with a paper consent form, particularly when working in a hot and humid climate and it can also be easily backed up. Transcription session with Abel Sam Image Source: Harriet Sheppard Each time I made a recording with a speaker or speakers, I played the recording back to them to check that they were happy with the recording and so that they could decide on what sort of access conditions they wanted the archived recording to have. If the speaker was not satisfied with the recording, sometimes they would choose to make another recording and delete the original or simply delete the recording and maybe try again later. If they were happy with the recording, they would decide on the access conditions they wanted for the archived recording. The possibilities ranged from the most restricted, being that only I, as the original researcher, could access the recordings and use them for my research, to the opposite end of the access continuum where anyone interested could download and listen to the recordings, read any transcriptions, and potentially use them for educational or research purposes. In between these two ends of the continuum, they could opt for other access conditions such as only allowing access for registered users of the archive, or only for researchers and speakers, or just for speakers. They could also choose to have a text embargoed for a certain period of time.

In order to study language change in real-time, the project also incorporates legacy data from two sources: a sociolinguistic project carried out in the late 1970s and an oral history collection created during the 1980s. Altogether, the birth years of the participants span over a century, from the 1890s to the 1990s, and five age groups are represented, as captured in Figure 1.

We describe the ways in which recordings were made and transcription was managed; outline how we were able to get comparable demographic information from participants when this was not standardised across the corpora; and detail how we dealt with participant consent and privacy. We close by reviewing a set of data access concerns around de-identification, data security and access and re-use. In this overview of the process by which different datasets collected for distinct purposes and under varying conditions have been brought together to constitute a coherent corpus of language data, we hope to highlight some of the considerations key to working with sociolinguistic data, and the enormous potential for the incorporation of other data sources through the use of appropriate standards for data management.

Data collection is still ongoing, but as of June 2023, Sydney Speaks 2010s comprises 142 sociolinguistic interviews with men and women of varying ages from different ethnic communities in Sydney representing some of the largest ethnic minorities in Australia, namely Anglo-Celtic, Chinese, Greek, and Italian Australians. The interviews were generally conducted individually (though some were done in pairs), and they were conducted by community members, typically with people they knew. The interviewers were provided with a list of suggested topics, covering such things as childhood memories, growing up in Sydney, school and work experiences, and for the Greek, Italian and Chinese participants, engagement with their ethnic community and language, but they were told to use these as a guide only, and to follow the participants’ lead in choosing topics. Thus, the data is highly interactional, in some cases conversational, and topics vary greatly across recordings. There is a focus on recording narratives of personal experience, as these have been demonstrated to be particularly ideal for recording the everyday vernacular (Labov 1984:32-42). After the sociolinguistic interview, participants read aloud a word list, which provides a comparison for both the sociolinguistic interview data and other studies of Australian English (as many have focused on read word lists). The suggested interview topics and the word list are given in Figures 2a and 2b. Figure 2a: Suggested interview topics Image Source: Catherine Travis Figure 2b: Suggested word list Image Source: Catherine Travis Recordings and transcripts Interviews are recorded using a Zoom H4N digital recording device in WAV format at 44.1 kHz/16 bits. They are orthographically transcribed, aligned at the utterance level and then uploaded into LaBB-CAT (Language, Brain and Behaviour Corpus Analysis Tool (Fromont \u0026 Hay 2012)), for forced alignment (which automates the process for alignment at the level of the phoneme). LaBB-CAT also serves as the corpus management tool, where the corpus is stored, data is further annotated, and concordance searches can be conducted. LaBB-CAT does not include corpus analysis tools as such, but data can be downloaded in multiple formats to allow for analyses, including CSV and WAV, as well as in formats that are compatible with tools that are used widely by linguists, such as ELAN, illustrated in Figure 3 (Lausberg \u0026 Sloetjes 2009) and Praat in Figure 4 (Boersma \u0026 Weenink 2019).

This questionnaire is conducted orally at the end of the interview (as a continuation of the interview), and the participants’ responses are filled in by the interviewer. Information is extracted from the written form, validated in the recorded audio, and added to a metadata spreadsheet in Excel. We use customised metadata, rather than drawing on a standard metadata vocabulary; however the demographic information from each sub-corpus is standardised in Excel and comparable across the three sub-corpora.

Variation in Australian English: The sociolects of Sydney. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press Sub-corpus overview The Sydney Social Dialect Survey (SSDS) is a collection of 177 sociolinguistic interviews with adult and teenage Australians from Anglo-Celtic, Greek, and Italian backgrounds, recorded in Sydney between 1977 and 1980, as part of an ARC-funded project led by Barbara Horvath, of the Department of Linguistics at the University of Sydney. For the Sydney Speaks project, recordings from Anglo-Celtic adults (born in the 1930s) and from Anglo-Celtic, Greek and Italian Teenagers (born in the 1960s) were included. The recordings with Greek and Italian adults were set aside, as they arrived in Australia as adults and speak English as a second language, and thus raise a different set of questions for the study of language variation and change. There were 7 participants who did not meet the Sydney Speaks participant criteria (e.g. one of their parents was not of the target ethnic groups), leaving a total of 20 adults and 72 teenagers for inclusion. Like the contemporary linguistic data, the Sydney Social Dialect Survey comprises sociolinguistic interviews, but these are more interview-like: the interviewers were not community members, and they did not typically know the participants; and the topics were more defined (some common topics being games, layout of the school, nicknames, and language). Recordings and transcripts Interviews were conducted in the 1970s with a cassette recorder and made available to the Sydney Speaks project directly by the lead researcher. The audio cassettes, type-written transcripts, and demographic information of the participants were stored in boxes in Horvath’s garage in Sydney and passed on to Catherine Travis in 2013. The cassettes (pictured in Figure 7) were digitised using PARADISEC equipment in the College of Asia Pacific Studies at the ANU to create WAV files (96.1 kHz, resampled using Audacity into smaller files of 44.1 kHz). Fortuitously, the cassettes had been preserved very well, and nearly all of them (124/130) were able to be digitised, and with further refinement, it was possible to conduct acoustic analyses (though in some cases, this presented considerable challenges that did not arise with the new recordings). The typewritten transcripts were scanned and digitised as PDFs, but it was not possible to convert them into machine-readable transcripts, partly because they had been marked up by hand for transcript corrections, coding and annotation, as can be seen in the sample in Figure 8. They were therefore re-transcribed in ELAN by the Sydney Speaks team, following the protocols applied for the contemporary data (see sample ELAN rendition of part of Figure 8 in Figure 9).

Further demographic information was added from several other sources, including participant overview documents put together by the lead researcher, original cassette labels as well as from the audio recordings themselves.

NSW Bicentennial oral history collection. Council on the Ageing NSW Branch and NSW Oral History Association of Australia, housed at the National Library of Australia. The process of conducting oral history involves recording interviews to collect information about the past, from the perspective of those who lived through relevant events. In recording everyday voices, oral histories are particularly valuable for research across Humanities disciplines as they capture the ‘little-heard voices of society’. They are of particular value for linguistic analysis, because they aim to ensure that ‘the historical record includes different languages and vernacular speech, accent and dialect’ (Oral History Statement of value; What is oral history? Retrieved May 23, 2022, from Oral History Australia). Like the sociolinguistic interview, oral histories elicit narratives of personal experience, and thus they provide highly comparable data. Sub-corpus overview The NSW Bicentennial Oral History Collection, produced by the NSW Bicentennial Oral History Project, comprises 200 interviews recorded in 1987 and 1988 with men and women born before 1910. The Sydney Speaks project has incorporated 31 interviews with people who were born in Sydney and whose parents were also born in Sydney. The recordings include discussions about life in Sydney in the early part of the twentieth century, including the war, women’s first experience in the workforce, the outbreak of the Spanish flu, and so on. The collection is managed by the State Library of NSW and the National Library of Australia. In 2017, the Sydney Speaks project gained access to the collection via direct request to the National Library of Australia. Recordings and transcripts The original audio of each interview was recorded on cassette tape and was made available to the Sydney Speaks team in MP3 and WAV format, allowing for acoustic analysis. Type-written transcripts (Figure 11) were also made available, from which the Sydney Speaks team was able to create machine-readable versions via OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The original transcript captured the content very accurately, and this was imported into ELAN and edited to produce detailed transcriptions that are aligned with the audio and facilitate linguistic analysis (Figure 12).

The recordings themselves also provided a wealth of demographic information, as is common practice in oral histories, meaning that full demographic profiles could be developed for most participants. Some investment is necessary to capture and systematise this information, but its availability is one of the clear advantages they have for (socio)linguistic analysis.

To indicate to the analyst what words are pseudonyms, all pseudonyms are marked (preceded by a tilde, e.g. ~Jane, ~Millers ~Point). For the audio, we identify the segment that needs de-identification, and run a low-pass filter using a Praat script so that the name is not recognisable. During an interview, some participants have requested that a section not be included in the study, generally due to what they perceive to be the sensitive nature of a certain topic (for example, one participant talking about banking in Hong Kong).

Issues such as ethics, data storage, and long-term data management plans were not of primary concern in the way that they are today, when we are guided by the FAIR principles around Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Re-usability. This does not mean, however, that older language collections (or collections made from other disciplines and for other purposes) cannot be made FAIR. The Sydney Speaks project has demonstrated that legacy corpora can be brought into line with standards appropriate for data in the current digital age. Integrating contemporary and legacy data collections in this way allows for an upscaling of our studies in both the size and the scope of the language data we work with, and in so doing can open a treasure trove of knowledge on Australian language, society, culture, and history.

This is not a simple problem because the relationship between languages and names for them is not one-to-one. Some languages have more than one name: for example, Farsi and Persian can both be used to refer to the same language. Some names refer to more than one language: for example, there are languages called Buru used in Nigeria and in Indonesia. To avoid the confusion that can arise from such situations, various systems have been developed to assign unique identifiers to languages. None of these systems gives a comprehensive list of languages and all such systems struggle with another problem, the distinction between separate languages and dialects of one language, as can be seen in the case study below.

When considering how data can be shared and accessed by others, it is important to consider these legal constraints. Copyright protects expressions of ideas in works such as books, music, paintings, films, and performative acts such as speech, sign and gesture, etc., and therefore also data collections. The creator of the work is known as the copyright owner. Copyright provides two types of rights: Economic rights: The owner has the exclusive right to reproduce, publish, perform, communicate, and adapt or modify their work, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. This right can be transferred or shared with others via assignment or licensing. Moral rights: The work must be correctly attributed and not treated in a derogatory manner. This protects the integrity of the work. Moral rights cannot be transferred or shared. Questions for reflection: How can I identify the copyright owner of a language collection? Unlike trademarks and patents, copyright doesn’t require registration and there are no official records that can be searched to identify a copyright owner in Australia. Additionally, the creator of material is not necessarily the copyright owner and copyright may also be jointly owned. Copyright ownership is determined according to a set of complex rules set out in the Copyright Act and its amendments. It is important to review in detail the law to ensure the correct owner has been identified. Legal advice should be sought where the copyright owner cannot be clearly identified. If the copyright owner has died the copyright is usually passed on to that person’s spouse or children. (See more information at the end of this section.) The copyright owner of a language collection can be identified by considering the following questions: Question Further Information Does the collection comprise materials all collected under the same conditions? (e.g. as part of the same research project)YesNo If the collection includes material from a third party, the copyright owner and copyright status should be identified for each subset of the collection. Has the copyright owner been determined by a contract, formal agreement, or other relevant document?YesNo In some cases, existing contracts or agreements will assign copyright ownership in advance. This will take precedence over the rules set out in the Copyright Act. What type of material is included in the collection?Textual workMusical workDramatic workComputer programArtistic workFilm or videoSound recordings Generally, the author of a textual work, musical work, dramatic work, computer program or artistic work (i.e. the person who created the work) is the first owner of copyright. However, the general rules for films, videos and sound recordings are different.For sound recordings, copyright is owned by the ‘maker’ of the sound recording, typically the person or company who owns the recording equipment.For film and video, copyright is owned by the person or company which made the arrangements for the creation of the work.In the academic context, this is typically the university where the research was conducted. Was the material created by an employee in the course of their employment?YesNo When the work was created by an employee as part of their usual work duties, the employer is the copyright owner (unless there is a specific employment agreement that specifies otherwise). Is the work a performance?YesNo Performers’ rights apply to live performances including dramatic works, musical works, dances, circus acts, expressions of folklore, readings, and recitations of existing or improved literary works recorded or filmed with or without an audience. Permission must be sought to record the live performance, and to broadcast and distribute recordings.As of 1 January 200","date":"2023-10-18","objectID":"/resources/ldaca-resources/guidance-for-data-governance-decisions/:2:1","tags":null,"title":"Guidance for Data Governance Decisions","uri":"/resources/ldaca-resources/guidance-for-data-governance-decisions/"},{"categories":null,"content":"1.2 Licensing Documenting access conditions is key to ensuring appropriate use of the data over time. Transparency and clarity surrounding access conditions also supports the sustainability of the data and reduces the need for the Data Steward to be available to communicate or enforce the access conditions. While access conditions can be documented internally in a data management plan, a common and useful mechanism for documenting and managing access is via licensing. Licensing allows the copyright owner to share the right to access and use the data without forfeiting or transferring the ownership of the copyright of the work. The license sets out the conditions for who can access the data, how it can be used, and what other conditions are required. While licensing is a legal mechanism, it can also be used to uphold other conditions as determined by the Data Steward. Questions for reflection: Is there an existing data license? Question Further Information Is there an existing license outlining the access conditions?YesNo If the collection has already been made available, a license may have already been prepared. Avoid duplicating previous work by checking this first. Although it is best practice to have a single license attached to a collection, multiple licenses can exist as long as they are non-exclusive. Questions for reflection: What information needs to be included in the license? Key parts of a data license Image Source: LDaCA Question Further Information What are the parties relevant to this license? Who is the author of the material? Who is the copyright owner? Is access managed by a Data Steward? Which individuals or groups are permitted access to the material? Who is the Licensor (copyright owner) and Licensee? What materials are covered by the license? Does this license cover the entire collection or a subset of the material? Is this an exclusive or non-exclusive license? Does this license grant an individual or group exclusive rights to use and share the material? If yes, this is an exclusive license. Describe the rights that are being transferred to the licensee. What rights are being transferred? Can the material be modified? For what purpose? Can the material be shared? Under what conditions? Does this collection include sensitive information? Does the material include personal information? What is the protocol for ensuring participant privacy? What are the responsibilities of the licensee? What are the requirements surrounding citation? How should the material be correctly attributed? What is the suggested citation for the collection? Under which region is the license legally binding? Is the license limited to a specific geographical region? Other considerations How long will the license be valid? Does it expire after a specific period of time? Is the licensee required to pay a fee? How is the fee processed? Under what conditions can the license be terminated? How will disputes be resolved? While in some cases it may be necessary to write a custom data license, for other collections it may be possible to apply an already-existing license, such as a Creative Commons license. Creative Commons provides a useful option for promoting data reusability while protecting key access conditions. The Creative Commons licenses combine four main elements in different ways: BY - Attribution: This is a requirement for all Creative Commons licenses. The original creator must always be attributed. SA - Share-Alike: Data can only be shared under identical license terms. NC - Non-Commercial: Only non-commercial use of the data is permitted. ND - No Derivatives: Material can be copied and distributed in the original form only and cannot be adapted. A copyright owner may also choose to waive their rights and make data available in the public domain before the duration of the copyright has expired.

Persistent Identifiers Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are digital identifiers that are permanently assigned to physical and digital objects. In contrast to other identifiers that are used online, such as URLs, PIDs are persistent, meaning they point to reliable information in the long term. They have become crucial for research data as they make a collection citable; ensure that it is findable even if moved to a different location; and establish its relationship to other objects and entities in the academic research environment (e.g. researchers, funders, organisations, academic publications, software and other datasets). While various PID systems have been in use for research data over the last 25 years, including ISBN and ORCiD, the DOI System has been the most widely used globally to date and is becoming the default identifier for research datasets. A DOI is a unique number made up of a prefix and a suffix separated by a forward slash. It is resolvable by displaying it as a link: https://doi.org/10.1000/182. An example of a DOI for a data collection (obtained via the university library) can be viewed here: Sydney Speaks DOI landing page. Questions for reflection: Who can get a DOI? How? Question Further Information Does the collection have an existing PID?YesNo Investigate whether the collection already has an existing PID as this is sometimes automatically generated when the collection is listed or archived with an archive or library. Who can generate a DOI for the collection? The most common DOI minting services are universities, research organisations, research libraries and research repositories. You can make enquiries with your university library or the research repository of the organisation that supported the data collection.

Metadata Metadata is data about data — information that describes the data collection as a whole; provides the context and conditions under which the data was collected, can be stored, shared and used; and the characteristics of the format, duration or size of data making up the collection; and includes socio-demographic details of participants. Standardised metadata allows data to be more easily found and understood, to be compared, and grouped with other similar objects. Metadata is often managed in two different ways: A standard metadata vocabulary (such as Dublin Core (DC), Darwin Core and Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS). These vocabularies set out a limited list of metadata terms that can be used across disciplines with the aim of promoting a shared metadata framework. A customised metadata strategy, unique to a particular project to meet specific needs. Where a customised metadata strategy is used, metadata terms should be clearly defined so as to facilitate comprehension of the metadata and to avoid misunderstandings or multiple interpretations. Customised metadata terms can be mapped onto existing vocabularies in order to organise metadata in a manner aligned to a standard. Questions for reflection: What does it mean to apply standards to metadata? Question Further Information Does the collection use metadata terms from an existing metadata vocabulary?YesNo If the collection uses customised metadata terms (i.e. not an existing metadata vocabulary), consider mapping the relationships between the custom system and an existing metadata vocabulary. This will facilitate findability as the metadata aligns with standards used in the research community.

CT: Our main goal at the Australian National University is to grow the set of collections that will be incorporated into LDaCA with a particular focus on Australian English and migrant languages. This involves identifying relevant collections, which is a bit of a ‘language dig’, as these are diverse, dispersed, and often quite hidden away. Many have restrictions around data sharing, so we work closely with data stewards to set up the appropriate access and licensing conditions. As well as this, we are developing tools that can enhance the usability of both legacy corpora and newer collections, including tools for aligning transcripts that exist in different formats with their corresponding audio, standardising orthography, streamlining the anonymisation process, and so on. Right now, most of what we know about Australian English comes from middle-class Australians of Anglo-Celtic background living in major urban centres. A better representation of Australian society in our language collections will broaden the scope of the research that can be done, allow new questions to be asked, and provide a better picture of Australia overall. NE: My role is to keep our foot on the gas for the huge job of getting a continued flow of new corpus data, as well as digitised legacy data, mostly for the languages of New Guinea and the Pacific. MB: I’m the Academic Lead for these projects at the University of Sydney. In this role, I manage the projects overall and work closely with staff from the Sydney Corpus Lab and the Sydney Informatics Hub. We develop text analytics tools and training for analysis of text/language, including but not limited to tools for linguistic and discourse analysis. A team at PARADISEC is also involved and contributes to work packages around language collections for Indigenous languages of Australia and the Pacific. My role as director of the Sydney Corpus Lab is crucial for these projects. The lab’s mission is to build research capacity in corpus linguistics at the University of Sydney, to connect Australian corpus linguists, and to promote the method in Australia, both in linguistics and in other disciplines. We organise relevant events on corpus linguistics and text analytics, including guest lectures and workshops, and create resources such as corpora, blog posts, video playlists, and curated introductions in different languages.

CT: There is a wide range of collections out there that represent an absolute treasure trove of knowledge not only for language in Australia, but also for Australian society, culture, and history. For example, oral histories or ethnographic interviews can provide invaluable linguistic data, and likewise, sociolinguistic interviews may contain invaluable information for historians, sociologists, or anthropologists. But because there is no way to know what collections exist, what is in them, and what is accessible, this treasure trove is underutilised. With many decades of data collection behind us and with recent technological developments, now is the perfect time to open this up to create a language data commons. It is exciting to think of the opportunities that this presents for us to cross disciplinary boundaries, and expand our understanding of Australia’s social, cultural, and linguistic history. NE: We all know that most of the world’s languages are under-resourced, lacking even a grammar or dictionary. A dream I have – which this project will move us very slightly toward – is that every one of the world’s 7,000 languages might one day have a vast library of corpus data, comparable to the 60 million words we have for Classical Greek, for example. Each language and culture deserves its own vast library wing. To give an idea of the scale of the challenge, so far in our part of the world there are only three languages (Bislama, Gurindji Kriol, and Ku Waru) where we have even one million words.

It is standard practice to contextualise the research that we do within the field; we are at a point where we should be doing the same with data collection.

We need the equivalent of Biblical or Talmudic commentaries for the digital age – metatexts that comment on what other texts mean. MB: Just give it a go and don’t be daunted! Go to workshops or summer schools, and avail yourself of other free or low-cost opportunities. Be (and remain) critical in your use of tools, and remember the value of your own knowledge and expertise. Discover the joy of mastering a new tool/technique or of knowing enough to find out that it is not for you or for your research project. If you find it useful, practice and also keep good notes so that you can return to the tool later and still know what to do. Always be transparent in how you use the tool/technique and make sure you know why you are using it.

Authorization Required Different levels of implementation:click-through licenseby invitationby application (case-by-case approval by Data Steward) Data is available with some restrictive conditions of use, as outlined in the license. Users must authenticate their identity to access these materials. In some cases, access to the license is limited to specific users, who can be defined by invitation and/or application (note that these are not mutually exclusive – either or both options may be implemented). Such authorisation requires ongoing engagement from the Data Steward in order to manage access lists and approve/decline access requests. A number of levels of authorization can be implemented depending on the access conditions:License acceptance: the user must read and accept the license (click-through) before accessing the data.By invitation: the Data Steward invites users to access and accept the license. Only invited users can gain access.By application: specific conditions apply, and the user must provide extra information to gain access, which they do through a linked application form which must be reviewed and approved by the Data Steward before access is granted.

If the collection does not have an existing persistent identifier, LDaCA recommends getting a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which is becoming the default identifier for research datasets. A DOI makes a collection citable; it ensures that it is findable even if moved to a different location; and it establishes its relationship to other objects and entities in the academic research environment (e.g. researchers, funders, organisations, academic publications, software and other datasets). See Obtaining a DOI for more information. Providing metadata that is organised with a consistent structure, and includes descriptors, definitions and contextual information where relevant. This includes metadata at the level of the collection (e.g. collection name, a narrative description of the corpus, the subject language(s), author(s) or Collector(s), publication year, access conditions, etc.), file (e.g. length in minutes, words) and participants (e.g. age, gender). LDaCA technologies enable programmatic detection, extraction and summarisation of existing metadata in a dataset; in order for this to work effectively, the metadata must be standardised. Metadata are mapped to open schemas including the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) vocabularies for describing language data and Schema.org for generic descriptions (e.g. Name, Identifier, Description). This approach allows many metadata terms to be linked to openly available and widely used definitions. Some metadata may be specific to a corpus or difficult to map to existing vocabulary terms. LDaCA makes use of the Language Data Ontology, which has been developed in consultation with OLAC and metadata specialists, to ensure consistency across terms. See Metadata for more information.

The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) and Indigenous Research Data Commons (HASS+I RDC). The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities. The platform will provide workbench services to support computational research, starting with code-notebooks with no-code research tools provided in later phases. Research artefacts such as code and derived data will be made available as fully documented research objects that are re-runnable and rigorously described. Metrics to demonstrate the impact of the platform are projected to include usage statistics, data and article citations. These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions. We would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands on which we live and work and the importance of Indigenous knowledge, culture and language to these projects. Peter Sefton lives and works on Wiradjuri land, and for Nick Thieberger and Simon Musgrave, it’s the land of the Kulin nation. PARADISEC is an online archive of cultural data which has been maintained for twenty years, in this presentation, we will look at some of the lessons learned from PARADISEC. In summary – the PARADISEC approach to simple data and metadata storage is something we want to continue in LDaCA, while the high cost for PARADISEC of commissioning and maintaining its own software stack is something we want to address by taking a more standards-based approach to managing language and other data over the coming decades. The Arkisto platform started in 2019 as a way to capture the lessons of PARADISEC and other projects such as Alveo (another language data project similar in scope to LDaCA) which was presented at OR 2014: Sefton PM, Estival D, Cassidy S, Burnham D, Berghold J.

In this blog post series, we feature interviews with the Chief Investigators of the two projects. In each post, we present their answers to three questions: What is your role in these projects? (What do you/your team do as part of your participation?) What excites you most about the projects? (What motivates you to participate?) What advice would you give someone who wants to get started with text analytics, corpus linguistics, or language data collection? This blog post features Louisa Willoughby (LW), Martin Schweinberger (MS) and Nick Thieberger (NT). The interview was undertaken via email, and we are grateful to Kelvin Lee from the Sydney Corpus Lab for his assistance in undertaking the interviews and creating these blog posts.

LW: I’m the academic lead on the multimodal corpus. We’re building infrastructure for people to create video dictionaries that link to corpus examples (and vice versa), using Signbank and the Auslan corpus as our test case. MS: I am a Chief Investigator and steering committee member of the Australian Text Analytics (ATAP) Project and I am also a CI of the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA). I am particularly focusing on the Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL) which is part of ATAP and represents an infrastructure for computational text analytics in the humanities. LADAL has an outreach component as it organises webinars and workshops and it provides computational resources in the form of self-paced online tutorials as well as interactive notebooks that allow researchers to try out methods and apply them to their own data. I see my task as organising and managing activities around LADAL by creating and optimizing resources as well as getting involved in outreach via events and building (inter-)national partnerships and collaborations with other computational humanities infrastructures. NT: I am in charge of work packages 1.1 and 1.2, Indigenous languages of Australia and the Pacific. I worked at AIATSIS in the past and set up an Aboriginal language centre in Port Hedland (Wangka Maya). I have worked in Vanuatu, and did my PhD research on Nafsan, a language from Efate, sparking an interest in languages of the Pacific. The work of recording speakers of Nafsan also resulted in a corpus of time-aligned text and media, as well as historical manuscripts that I have been finding in archives around the world. This led me to be concerned that existing records of these languages be made accessible to current speakers and so I helped establish the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC) which has many connections to cultural agencies in the Pacific. I currently lead a project (Nyingarn) to convert manuscripts in Australian Indigenous languages to text.

LW: That it is both building an exciting tool for researchers to better understand language variation AND making a resource that is useful for Auslan students and members of the community. MS: One of the most fulfilling aspects of my work is the opportunity to collaborate with researchers from diverse communities and fields or to see how resources I created help people from very different backgrounds in their work. I do take pride in inspiring and enabling researchers to explore the potential of computational methods, whether they are working on projects related to the language sciences, health sciences, social sciences, arts, or beyond. As a quantitative linguist who came to computation as a computerphobe philosopher, I really enjoy creating visualizations that communicate data and results and that provide an intuitive understanding of complex data sets. I also take pleasure in showing others how to perform statistical analyses that help them make informed decisions based on their findings. By optimizing workflows and automating procedures, I help researchers to work more efficiently and effectively, enabling them to achieve their goals more quickly and easily. Through my work, I aim to create an environment where researchers from diverse backgrounds and specializations can benefit from the potential of computational tools, regardless of their field of study or level of experience. I value the opportunity to work collaboratively with researchers to find solutions to complex problems, and to share my expertise with others to promote innovation and growth within the field. Overall, I believe that the application of computational methods is an exciting area of research that has the potential to transform the way we approach scientific inquiry in the humanities and social sciences. By helping researchers to explore the possibilities of these tools, I hope to contribute to a more vibrant and innovative research community. NT: Making textual material in these languages available so that speakers can find records in their own languages. Often there is very little available information for these languages, so every record becomes all the more important, especially in the context of colonial dispossession where the languages are no longer spoken everyday and there are efforts to relearn the language. It is exciting that this work can become part of a national commons, and be supported into the future, so that more and more material can be included. The simple task of locating a language record, digitising it, and making the files available with appropriate licenses means that it can be used by speakers, and by researchers for various new purposes.

LW: Jump in and start playing! There are lots of different tools and corpora online and I find it easiest to learn how to use them by just having a go and seeing what you can get out. It can be fun to look for little bits of variation or to see how common a certain word or phrase is, and doing something small will give you a sense of the kind of data you get out of the tools and how you might then incorporate them into a wider project. MS: If you’re just starting out with a new project, it’s essential to take it one step at a time. Start with a simple visualization or basic text processing task, such as concordancing, and build on it gradually. Don’t be intimidated by others who may have more experience or skills than you do. Instead, take the opportunity to learn from them and seek their guidance when necessary. It’s important to keep in mind that progress takes time, and comparing yourself to others can be discouraging. Instead, focus on comparing your current skills and accomplishments to your former self. Take pride in what you’ve created and the progress you’ve made. Celebrate your small wins and use them as motivation to keep moving forward. Another key to improving your skills is to seek feedback from others. Share your work with peers, mentors, or instructors who can provide constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or seek clarification when you’re unsure of something. Remember that learning is a continuous process, and even the most experienced professionals have room for growth and improvement. Embrace the journey, enjoy the learning process, and stay motivated by setting achievable goals for yourself. By doing so, you’ll be well on your way to developing your skills and achieving your goals. NT: The first steps in language data collection involve recording speakers, with all appropriate permissions in place, and with a consent form signed by them. Making those recordings as well as possible, following recommendations, doing training and so on, and managing the resulting files so they are not lost. Learn the basics of text querying, searching, and regular expressions. Be aware of the ethical considerations in using material from someone else’s language. But just start now!

But what does this include? We are aware of many data sources and, in the short term, the important questions are about priorities: What will be immediately useful? What data is stored precariously? What relationships can be leveraged? But in thinking for the long term, there is value in asking the question from a more conceptual point of view: What were the possibilities for making records of language use over our history and what has resulted (and not resulted) from those possibilities? I will try to at least start answering that question by providing a conceptual map of a metaphorical landscape and this will be structured around two themes: demography and technology. Demography is important because what languages were being used at any particular time depends on who was living in Australia at that time. On this dimension, the major point of articulation is the arrival of non-Indigenous people. The places of origin of those non-Indigenous people have changed over time, and that has had linguistic consequences, but not on the same scale as the initial change. Technology is important because the kinds of records which might exist of language use depend on the means which were available to make such records at a given time. And on this dimension, I think that there are three points of articulation that are important: the possibility of making written records, the possibility of recording sound and vision, and the possibility of digital records. Before European contact, Australia had a very diverse linguistic ecology. Credible estimates of the number of distinct languages range from around 250 up to as many as 490, with many more dialects. Contact between language groups was common and therefore multilingualism and multidialectalism were also common. We know that there was contact between Indigenous Australians and fishermen from the Indonesian archipelago (especially Makassarese people) from the evidence of loan words. But the only record which existed of this period in the linguistic history of the continent was what was passed from one generation to another by oral transmission. The presence of Europeans on the Australian continent brought a huge change to both dimensions of the map I am developing. Europeans landed on parts of Australia from some time in the 17th century, but I will take two dates in the 18th century to be crucial. Although earlier visitors may have recorded a few words which they heard from Indigenous Australians, written records of the languages only start properly (and even then to a limited extent) with Cook’s expedition in 1770, reflecting perhaps the scientific orientation of Joseph Banks. This is the first point of technological articulation in the language data landscape which introduced the possibility of making language records independent of human memory. And then from 1788, there has been a continuous non-Indigenous presence in Australia representing a huge demographic articulation point. During the 19th century (and into the 20th century), written records of Australian languages were produced by a variety of people such as explorers, missionaries, administrators (in fact, pretty much anyone who could be bothered). These records are scattered and new material continues to be found (for example, Des Crump’s ongoing work in the State Library of Queensland and the Queensland State Archives). If you would like to get a flavour of some records of this kind, the Nyingarn project is making many of them available online. (Nyingarn builds on earlier work which presented the Indigenous language materials collected by Daisy Bates as an online resource.) However, the efforts of these early recorders were sporadic, uncoordinated and poorly focused. In 1945, Sydney Baker wrote: “Records of their languages are extremely deficient for","date":"2022-12-07","objectID":"/news/posts/data-map/:0:0","tags":["Australia","language data"],"title":"Language data in Australia - Mapping a conceptual landscape","uri":"/news/posts/data-map/"},{"categories":["LDaCA"],"content":" PDF version By Peter Sefton, Nick Thieberger, Marco La Rosa, Simon Musgrave, River Tae Smith, Moises Sacal Bonequi – delivered by Peter Sefton at eResearch 2022 in Brisbane This work is licensed under CC BY 4.0. To view a copy of this license, visit http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This presentation will look at how a Metadata Standard - RO-Crate - with Metadata Profile (the Language Data Commons) is being developed and implemented. Two major collections are collaborating on the standard, PARADISEC and the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA). This ongoing standardisation effort for language data is designed to improve interoperability, reduce costs for data migration and allow storage on disk, object storage or in archival repositories. RO-Crate is a linked-data metadata system which allows discovery metadata (Who, what where) based on the widely adopted Schema.org vocabulary to be seamlessly integrated with more discipline-specific metadata. RO-Crate uses metadata profiles to provide guidance for packaging resources for particular disciplines and purposes. In this presentation, we will introduce a RO-Crate metadata profile for language data which extends the core RO-Crate standard with new vocabulary terms adapted from pre-linked-data discipline-specific metadata efforts, particularly the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) standards. The profile has English-language guidance on how to structure collections of resources in a repository with links between them, such that they can be indexed and displayed via APIs and search/browse portals. The profile is also implemented as a series of machine-readable profiles for the Describo Online metadata description system. We will demonstrate current ways of describing items in a variety of languages and modes (spoken, written and signed), from a large set of heterogeneous language resources held by PARADISEC and LDaCA. We will also show how to access them via API calls and a search portal, and how resources may be stored in simple storage systems using the Arkisto platform (a set of standards and principles).

The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are building towards a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons.

The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities.

These projects are led by Professor Michael Haugh of the School of Languages and Culture at the University of Queensland with several partner institutions. This work is supported by the Australian Research Data Commons. Last year at eResearch Australasia, the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) team presented a design for a distributed access control system which could look after the A-is-for-accessible in FAIR data; in this presentation, we describe and demonstrate a pilot system based on that design, showing how data licenses that allow access by identified groups of people to language data collections can be used with an AAF pilot system (CILogon) to give the right people access to data resources. The ARDC have invested in a pilot of this work as part of the HASS Research Data Commons and Indigenous Research Capability Program integration activities. The system has to be able to implement data access policies with real-world complexity and one of our challenges has been developing a data access policy that works across a range of different collections of language data. Here we present a pilot data access policy that we have developed, describing how this policy captures the decisions that must be made by a range of data providers to ensure data accessibility that complies with diverse legal, moral and ethical considerations. We will discuss how the CARE and FAIR principles underpin this work, and compare this work to other projects such as CADRE, which promise to deliver more complex solutions in the future. Initial work is with collections curated in a research context but we will also address community access to these resources. The idea is to separate safe storage of data from its delivery. Each item in a repository is stored with licensing information in natural language (English at the moment, but could be other languages) and the repository defers access decisions to an Authorization system, where data custodians can design whatever process they like for granting license access. This can range from simple click-through licenses where anyone can agree to license terms, to detailed multi-step workflows where applicants are vetted based on whatever criteria the rights holder wishes; qualifications, membership of a cultural group, have they paid a subscription fee, etc Regarding rights, our project is informed by the CARE principles for Indigenous data which also describe the level of respect which should be given to any data collected from individuals or communities.

There are a few reasons for the distributed approach we have taken in LDaCA: ACLs need maintenance over time - people’s identities change, they retire and die, so storing a list of identifiers such as email addresses alongside content is not a viable long-term preservation strategy. Rather, we will encourage data custodians to describe in words what are permitted uses for the data, and by whom, in a license, then allow whomever is the current data custodian to manage that access in a separate administrative system. We expect these administrative systems to be ephemeral, and change over time but also to generate less friction over time as standards are developed. Expected future benefits of concentrating these processes will include that people do not have to prove the same claims they make about themselves multiple times and that it is easier for data custodians to authorise access. LDaCA data will be stored in a variety of places with separate portal applications serving data for specific purposes; if these systems all have in-built authorization schemes, even if they are the same, then we have the problem of synchronizing access control lists around a network of services. Accessing data that requires some sort of authorization process is not language or humanities-specific, so working with an existing application that can handle pre-authorization workflows and access-control authorization decisions is an attractive choice and should allow LDaCA to take advantage of centrally managed services with functionality that improves over time rather than having to develop and maintain our own systems. If complex access controls are implemented inside a system then there is a risk that data becomes stranded inside that system and cannot be reused without completely re-implementing the access control. For example, imagine an archive of cultural material with complex access controls encoded into the business logic such as “this item is accessible only to male initiates”. Applications like this need to store user accounts with attributes on both data and user records that can be used to authorise access. There is a high risk of data being stranded in a system such as this if it is no longer supported. This will be mitigated somewhat if the rules are also expressed as licenses, perhaps a composition of Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels - but the access system is baked-in to the application and not portable.

The point of Research Data Commons projects like LDaCA is to create an ecosystem where data can be re-used. For language data, this means that users, including researchers and community members, will be able to download data for certain authorised purposes and activities. The license is the way that data custodians communicate to data users (and future administrators) what those purposes and activities are. A license, which is always packaged with data will allow: A user to inspect a five-year-old dataset in their downloads folder and work out what they are allowed to do with it. An IT professional to clean up a laptop that has been handed in by (or seized from – it happens) a departing faculty member.

No, and Yes No, there is no lock-in regarding the list of Licenses and pre-authorised users; licenses and access control lists can be exported via an API so it is possible to import them into another system or save them for audit purposes. Yes, there is lock-in, in that at this stage the workflow used to give access to users is specific to the system (such as REMS) But, because our process requires a governance step first in writing a license, then there is a statement of intent for re-building those processes later if needed - a step which is very likely to be missing in a system with built-in access control. Also, over time, we expect the administrative burden of constructing workflows will become less as standards are developed for a couple of things: Licenses can be made less complex (particularly in the context of academic studies) if they specify re-use by particular known cohorts in advance - this comes down to improving the design of studies to encourage data reuse. This may also help to simplify academic ethics processes in the medium to long term. The CADRE project is looking to improve pre-authorization workflows that automatically source relevant information about potential users - fetching their publication record, and potentially remembering what certifications they have, so these attributes can be used and reused for decision-making. It is conceivable that this approach might be useful in cultural contexts as well to allow data custodians to manage data sharing - this is a discussion we have yet to have in the broader HASS RDC.

But all of the issues identified above with application-specific ACLs are the same, no matter the size of the cohort: the data set can’t be access controlled outside of its home system. If the system is no longer running then the data may be completely inaccessible, and if there is no license document stored with the data setting out terms of re-use in general terms then there is no indication to future administrators about who, if anyone, should have access of the data.

These slides briefly outline the AAF process for the next phase that will provide the foundations for the development of the service and the creation of those policies to support the community and the service. This process will support the project to deliver a viable service that meets researchers’ needs and is trusted by the community and the participants to safely distribute data to authorised persons. The AAF’s business analyst is conducting interviews with the key stakeholders. This discovery process will collect information on the current and the “to-be” state of the service. Together these will establish goals and expectations and provide the basis for further prototyping a service that meets stakeholder needs. The process will facilitate the building of a service that empowers the data custodians, the communities and participants to manage access.

My designs reflect my appreciation of the past and my hope for the future. The design of the LDaCA logo came from my own experience researching the Waanyi language, the language of my mob. The design flows from the beginning to the end, where it flows back into itself at the beginning, representing the cyclical nature of life and the Land. The strands of language interweave with themselves, influenced by everything that touches them until they become something entirely their own. The complexity of these languages is a thing of beauty and their preservation, study and proliferation lays claim to this unceded land. The inspiration of the design is as follows: L (Language) - Language is shown as a flow of words that can be merged, split and rearranged to create different meanings, just as these lines can be. D (Data) - Data is depicted by these specks of raw information, undecipherable before processing but heavy with power. a - This data is not just numbers and words but aspects of cultures and knowledge with connections to the land. C (Commons) - Whilst research often appears niche in these commons, there is no limit to the range of it’s influence, the ripples of which disrupt everything it touches. A (Australia) - The language data of this common has been collected from many individual nations that make up ‘Australia’, often with a foundation on extraction based research techniques. This project aims to make up for the mistakes of the past by celebrating and giving back to these nations, which are so incredibly distinct whilst sharing beautiful connections with each other. The colours utilised in this design draw from those that are seen in my peoples land of Boodjamulla, in the Gulf of Carpentaria (see below). They reflect the connections between the Sky, the People and the Land in the hope that these connections continue to strengthen indefinitely.

Thanks to Simon Musgrave for reviewing this and adding a little detail here and there. (This is also available on Dr Sefton’s site) PDF version The Language Data Commons of Australia Data Partnerships (LDaCA) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) are establishing a scalable and flexible language data and analytics commons. These projects will be part of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Data Commons (HASS RDC). The Data Commons will focus on preservation and discovery of distributed multi-modal language data collections under a variety of governance frameworks. This will include access control that reflects ethical constraints and intellectual property rights, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and Pacific communities. For this Research Data Commons work, we are using the Arkisto Platform (introduced at eResearch 2020). Arkisto aims to secure the long-term preservation of data independently of code and services - recognizing the ephemeral nature of software and platforms. We know that sustaining software platforms can be hard and aim to make sure that important data assets are not locked up in a database or hard-coded logic of some hard-to-maintain application. We are using three key standards on this project … The first standard is the Oxford Common File Layout - this is a way of keeping version-controlled digital objects on a plain old filesystem or object store. Here’s the introduction to the spec: Introduction This section is non-normative. This Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification describes an application-independent approach to the storage of digital objects in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term access and management of digital objects within digital repositories. Need The OCFL initiative began as a discussion amongst digital repository practitioners to identify well-defined, common, and application-independent file management for a digital repository’s persisted objects and represents a specification of the community’s collective recommendations addressing five primary requirements: completeness, parsability, versioning, robustness, and storage diversity. Completeness The OCFL recommends storing metadata and the content it describes together so the OCFL object can be fully understood in the absence of original software. The OCFL does not make recommendations about what constitutes an object, nor does it assume what type of metadata is needed to fully understand the object, recognizing those decisions may differ from one repository to another. However, it is recommended that when making this decision, implementers consider what is necessary to rebuild the objects from the files stored. Parsability One goal of the OCFL is to ensure objects remain fixed over time. This can be difficult as software and infrastructure change, and content is migrated. To combat this challenge, the OCFL ensures that both humans and machines can understand the layout and corresponding inventory regardless of the software or infrastructure used. This allows for humans to read the layout and corresponding inventory, and understand it without the use of machines. Additionally, if existing software were to become obsolete, the OCFL could easily be understood by a lightweight application, even without the full feature repository that might have been used in the past. Versioning Another need expressed by the community was the need to update and change objects, either the content itself or the metadata associated with the object. The OCFL relies heavily on the prior art in the [Moab] Design for Digital Object Versioning which utilises forward deltas to track the history of the object.

But the rest of the world are bringing with them new approaches to how data is handled. This means that fields such as corpus linguistics may need to reassess their practices. Such reassessment includes addressing concerns about how data is stored and who can access it (data stewardship) – concerns that are a part of the Open Science movement, ultimately grounded on principles of equity and accountability. The most influential approach to data stewardship today is the FAIR principles. According to these principles, data should be: Findable Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Accessible Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation. Interoperable The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. Reusable The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. In general, corpus linguists do well on the interoperability criterion. Corpus data is usually stored in non-proprietary formats; even when some structure is imposed on the data, this is almost always in a form which is saved as a simple text file (e.g. CSV files or XML annotations). Data stored in such formats is easy to move between applications. But what about the other three criteria? Some corpus data is easy to discover; it is findable. For example, CLARIN, the portal to the European Union language resource infrastructure, provides access to many large data collections, as does the Linguistic Data Consortium in the USA. However, some data is never made part of a large collection and often remains under the control of individual researchers or research teams. Such data may be almost impossible to find. Even if we can find such data, it is unlikely to be accompanied by good descriptions of the data and metadata, making reusability problematic. Of course, big corpora such as the British National Corpus will be both findable and accompanied by comprehensive corpus manuals. However, it is worth considering how to make other corpora more findable, including the provision of corpus manuals or corpus descriptions. Corpus resource databases such as CoRD do aim to work towards this principle. Accessibility may also be an issue for some data. Copyright law may allow use of material for individual research but prohibit any further distribution of the material. The FAIR approach to such cases is that metadata should be available so that interested parties can know that a data holding exists (F), and the metadata will include information about the conditions under which the data may or may not be shared or reused (A and R). For linguists, there is another very important set of principles concerning data, the CARE principles developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance: Collective Benefit Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data. Authority to control Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Responsibility Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit. Ethics Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem. These principles are presented as applying particularly to Indigenous data, but we believe that researchers should adopt this approach in all cases where the people who particip","date":"2022-02-08","objectID":"/news/posts/fair-and-care/:1:0","tags":["FAIR","CARE"],"title":"What are the FAIR and CARE principles and why should corpus linguists know about them?","uri":"/news/posts/fair-and-care/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Refine your results according to a set of major metadata categories.","date":"2022-01-23","objectID":"/resources/user-guides/portal/filters/","tags":null,"title":"Filters","uri":"/resources/user-guides/portal/filters/"},{"categories":null,"content":" This user guide uses ‘portal’ to refer to the interface across all of the available Oni portals (see Available Portals for more details).

The image below shows how to apply for a data license in three steps: Go to Licenses to read the license terms. Clicking on the link will open these in a new tab. Then, still under Licenses, select Accept license. Go to Actions and select Submit application to activate the approval process. LDaCA-REMS Application Submission Steps Image Source: LDaCA Note that the application form above illustrates a basic license application procedure. Access restrictions and procedures for application approval will vary across collections (e.g. requiring applicants to complete a questionnaire, or to upload material explaining intended use of the data). Data stewards can set up the license application approval as an automated process (using bots) which takes 1-2 minutes to complete. Other data stewards might prefer to receive, review and approve or reject the application themselves, or designate a colleague for the task. Understandably, human-mediated approval is likely to take longer than an automated process. Every applicant will be sent an email notification confirming the submission of a license application, and another email confirming approval. Once approved, you should see all three tick marks under State: LDaCA-REMS State: Application Approved Image Source: LDaCA Navigate back to the data object you require. If the warning text is still displayed, click on refresh permissions. The page will update and you should be able to access the data.
