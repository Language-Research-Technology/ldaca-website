Sustainable management of and access to these significant collections of intangible cultural heritage are underpinned by two sets of complementary guiding principles of data management and stewardship, namely the FAIR and CARE principles. FAIR Principles The FAIR principles were first published by a group of stakeholders representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers.</description></item><item><title>Case-studies</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/background/case-studies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 17:13:28 +1000</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/background/case-studies/</guid><description>Fieldwork in Papua New Guinea Harriet Sheppard&amp;rsquo;s account of collecting data on a remote island in Papua New Guinea.

Corpus of Oz Early English CoOEE: a collection of texts written in Australia between 1788 and 1900. The corpus is divided into four time periods (1788–1825, 1826–1850, 1851–1875 and 1876–1900) each holding about 500,000 words. Four registers were defined for CoOEE: the Speech-based Register (SB), the Private Written Register (PrW), the Public Written Register (PcW) and the register of Government English (GE). In every Period 1-4 there is a similar number of words in the different registers.</description></item><item><title>Language Data - Background Information</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/background/information/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 17:13:28 +1000</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/background/information/</guid><description>Principles Information about the principles on which the work of LDaCA is based.

High quality metadata is important in making data FAIR:
Findable: metadata is the starting point for searching data collections. For example, if we want to find data in a particular language, this will only be possible for data which has a language recorded in its metadata. (Tracking languages is in itself problematic, see below.) Accessible: access conditions which apply to data should be part of the associated metadata.</description></item><item><title>Technologies</title><link>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/background/technologies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 17:13:28 +1000</pubDate><author>info@ldaca.edu.au (Language Data Commons of Australia)</author><guid>https://www.ldaca.edu.au/background/technologies/</guid><description>LDaCA is basing its data storage on the two technologies described below. The overall approach is informed by the Arkisto platform, taking the view that research data has interest and value that extends beyond funding cycles and its long term preservation and accessibility must continue to be managed. This presentation gives further details of the technical architecture.
Research Object Crates (RO-Crate) A Research Object (RO) is a structured archive of all the items that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations.</description></item></channel></rss>
