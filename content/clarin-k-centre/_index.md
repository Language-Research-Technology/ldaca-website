## Our centre
Good governance is important for any language data. Good goverance practice includes appropriate respect for and management of asymmetries in the relationship between the people who provide data and the researchers who collect, store and use data. Such asymmetries are particularly evident in work with languages spoken by minoritised communities, and it is the purpose of this centre to provide knowledge and expertise to researchers working with such groups.

The FAIR principles have influenced data management practices in the years since they were formulated, particularly in enabling the sharing of data between entities. But as pointed out by the Global Indgenous Data Alliance amongst others, these principles and practices ignore "power differentials and historical contexts". GIDA have set out a complementary set of principles for data governance, the CARE principles, which guide data creators and managers to consider both people and purpose in their advocacy and pursuits.

The CARE principles are grounded in consideration of the rights and needs of Indigenous peoples, but consideration of "power differentials and historical contexts" is also relevant for other communities, ones which we characterise as *minoritised*. Concern for these issues in linguistic research can be traced back over several decades at least to, for example, the work of Cameron and colleagues (Cameron et al 1993) who discuss these problems in various contexts, incuding working with socially stigmatised groups.

"Minoritised" describes groups made to feel or treated as a minority, regardless of their actual numbers, by dominant societal processes that erode their power, status, or representation through discrimination, often based on race, ethnicity, gender, or ability, highlighting power dynamics rather than just population size. It emphasizes that groups are subjected to minority status, not just statistically small. As reflected in the compostion of our team, examples of minoritised communities in language research include Indigenous peoples and other communities associated with endangered languages and speakers of heritage languages which are not the dominant language of the society in which they live.

The CARE principles set out a framework for thinking about our practices in relation to data relating to minoritised groups:
- Collective benefit: data practices should be designed to ensure that the people who are the source of the data derive benefit from it.
- Authority to control: the rights and interests of data providers must be recognised and their authority to control the data be empowered.
- Responsibility: those working with data from minoritised groups have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support the group's self-determination and collective benefit, providing meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the benefits accruing.
- Ethics: the rights and wellbeing of the people who are the source of data should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.
