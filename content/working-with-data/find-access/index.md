        description: 'Material to be included had to meet with a regional and a temporal criterion. The latter required texts to have been produced between 1788 and 1900 in order to become eligible for COOEE. It was mandatory for a text to have been written in Australia, New Zealand or Norfolk Island. But in a few cases, other localities were allowed. For example, if a person who was a native Australian or who had lived in Australia for a considerable time, wrote a shipboard diary or travelled in other countries. Contains: Letters, published materials in book form, historical texts. The collection is stratified in two ways: Time period - The corpus is divided into four time periods: Period 1: 1788-1825 Period 2: 1826-1850 Period 3: 1851-1875 Period 4: 1876-1900 The initial numeral of each file name indicates the period from which the document comes. Register - The corpus contains material from four registers: Speech-based (sb) Private written (prw) Public written (pcw) Government English (ge) The register to which a file belongs is specified in the metadata at the start of each file in the form <r=[register]> using the abbreviations above. This collection was previously accessible online via the Australian National Corpus (AusNC), an initiative managed by Griffith University between 2012 and 2023.

        title: 'Australian Deafblind Signing Corpus',
        description: 'Australian Deafblind Signing Corpus captures free conversations between consenting participants as well as discussions at two workshops. The vast majority of the free conversations in the corpus are between two deafblind people, but we also recorded conversations between our focal participant Heather Lawson and five sighted deaf people, as well as another deafblind-deaf conversation for comparative purposes. Conversations were often collected opportunistically: as part of wider deafblind events, consenting participants were approached and asked to bring a friend for a social chat (on a topic of their own choosing) that would be filmed and added to the corpus. In all cases participants knew each other prior to the recording taking place (often having known each other for decades). The workshop data comes from sessions organised by the project team to bring deafblind signers together to discuss metalinguistic issues, such as how they preferred to adapt certain features of visual Auslan for tactile perception (e.g. avoiding confusion when signing numbers – see Willoughby et al 2020). At our workshop each deafblind person worked with interpreters to access what was being signed by others in the room. As such there are multiple video files for the workshop, each focused on a different deafblind participant and their interpreting team. Data was collected between 2011-19, and collection and annotation was principally funded through an Australian Research Council Discovery Project. Melbourne deafblind woman Heather Lawson has been a research team member and focal informant for the project, with the core project team also including Louisa Willoughby, Meredith Bartlett, Jim Hlavac, Howard Manns, Shimako Iwasaki and Dennis Witcombe. The deafblind signers who appear in the corpus all have a significant dual sensory (vision and hearing) loss and use Auslan as their primary means of receptive communication. The participants overwhelmingly have degenerative eye conditions (such as Retinitis Pigmentosa), meaning all but one had enough sight as children to learn Auslan through visual perception. They have varied levels of residual vision but all use tactile signing under at least some lighting conditions. Those with sufficient residual vision sometimes use visual perception of signing in the corpus study, and we also see participants moving to more and more tactile reception over time as their vision deteriorates. It is important to note that even in instances where participants do use visual perception of sign languages they have marked vision impairments (including extreme tunnel vision) so are unlikely to perceive facial expressions or other bodily movements outside of their narrow field of vision.',

        description: 'The corpus of Australian English as a Second Language (AusESL) comprises audio-recorded sociolinguistic interviews with people who migrated to Australia as adults from non-English-speaking countries and have been living in Australia for at least two years. As of January 2024, the corpus has recordings with 30 Russian speakers (19 women & 11 men) and 30 Mandarin speakers (20 women & 10 men). The two groups are comparable in terms of age (average 36 years), age of arrival in Australia (average 26 years), and length of residence (average 11 years). All are tertiary-educated, and over two thirds have a post-graduate degree (N = 42). All speak English fluently, though with varying degrees of proficiency. The interviews were conducted in English by members of the respective communities in Sydney and Canberra in 2019. Individual interviews are about 60 minutes long, with 30 minutes (approx. 220,000 words) orthographically transcribed and automatically time-aligned at the segmental level, and can be accessed (with permission) through the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA). As a sociolinguistic corpus, AusESL provides the opportunity to ask questions around second language speakers’ acquisition of sociolinguistic variation in Australian English at the phonetic, morphosyntactic or discourse level. The data can also serve to examine listener perceptions of foreign accented speech and speakers, relevant, for example, for testing linguistic discrimination in Australia. The content of the interviews itself offers insights into the lived experiences of members of these migrant communities in contemporary Australia.',

The sub-corpora include the Bicentennial Oral History Project (with speakers born around 1900, and recorded in 1988); the Sydney Social Dialect Survey (with speakers born in the 1930s and 1960s, and recorded in 1977-1981; cf. Horvath 1985); and Sydney Speaks 2010s (with speakers born in the 1960s and 1990s, and recorded from 2014 to the present). All participants are native speakers of Australian English, and come from diverse ethnic backgrounds, currently Anglo-Celtic, Chinese, Greek and Italian (and this is under expansion). The sample is further stratified according to sex and social class. Approximately 5,000 words per speaker have been transcribed, for a total of some 1.5 million words. Orthographic transcriptions (including prosodic information) are time aligned at the level of the utterance, and have been force aligned to the level of the segment, making the data ideal for linguistic analysis at a range of levels. The socio-historical information in the recordings provides both information about the times the participants have lived through, and allows for social contextualisation of the linguistic patterns observed.',

The work of the AIATSIS Centre for Australian Languages (ACAL) has been fundamental in making archival language records more accessible, including in the enhancement of the Austlang database and associated coding system, their annual Paper and Talk event which supports community capacity-building in archival research and their long-running Dictionaries Program. We are very pleased to have AIATSIS on board as one of our advisory partners and we look forward to growing this collaboration across the life of the project.',

        description: 'CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) is a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) which supports the sharing, use and sustainability of multimodal digital language data and tools for humanities and social sciences research. CLARIN is a distributed virtual infrastructure, with a network of participating centres across Europe and beyond, including universities, research centres, libraries and public archives. Tools and data housed in different centres are interoperable, so that data collections can be combined and tools chained to perform complex operations, regardless of their location. CLARIN has taken the role of advisory partner to LDaCA and discussions about further collaboration are continuing.',
