    </summary>
  <p>
    The Language Data Commons of Australia is research infrastructure which aims to bring people, both academic and non-academic users, and data together.The data is nationally significant collections which represent language use in Australia, now and in our history.

        <b>What is metadata?</b>
    </summary>
    <p>
        Metadata is the information that defines and describes data.
        It is often referred to as data about data or information about data because it provides data users with information about the purpose, processes, and methods involved in the data collection.

        <b>What are FAIR and CARE?</b>
    </summary>
    <p>
        These are two complementary sets of principles for data management and stewardship.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the FAIR principles, data should be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Findable</li>
        <li>Accessible</li>
        <li>Interoperable</li>
        <li>Reuseable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        According to the CARE principles, developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance, our use of data should be guided by considering:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collective Benefit</li>
        <li>Authoruty to Control</li>
        <li>Responsibility</li>
        <li>Ethics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The CARE principles were developed in relation to Indigenous data, but we believe that researchers should adopt this approach in all cases where the people who participate in our research can be seen to have some moral rights in the information they have contributed.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the FAIR principles are about making it easier to share and reuse data, the CARE principles ensure that data is used ethically.
    </p>
    <p>
         We have more information about these principles on our <a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/background/principles/">website</a> and in our <a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/posts/fair-and-care/">blog</a>.
