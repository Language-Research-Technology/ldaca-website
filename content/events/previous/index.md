#### Workshop on community language corpora in Australia

Australia is a highly multilingual and multicultural society, with more than 490 languages coming from around 300 ancestries and cultural traditions (ABS, 2021, 2022). For decades, the language and cultural maintenance of various immigrant groups have been under investigation by many scholars, not only in linguistics but also in history, sociology, anthropology, and other disciplines. This work has amassed a large body of data reflecting the languages of these communities, providing information about how Australia’s immigration history has contributed to the country today.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together scholars working with language corpora from across different disciplines. The workshop is being run as part of the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA), which is working to build national research infrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences, facilitating sustainable access to and controlled use of digital language corpora for linguists, scholars across the Humanities and Social Sciences, and non-academics.

The workshop will consist of presentations on language data collected from Australian immigrant communities for different research purposes, and will close with a panel discussion on needs and challenges around managing and archiving community language data in a way that is ethical, legal and culturally sensitive, and how LDaCA can help support that.

**When**: 9-10 November 2023

**Organisers**: [Li Nguyen](mailto:li.nguyen@anu.edu.au) & Catherine Travis

#### Workshop on Language Corpora in Australia

Over decades of work in Australia, significant collections of language data have been amassed, including of varieties of Australian English, Australian migrant languages, Australian Indigenous languages, sign languages and others. These collections represent a trove of knowledge not only of language in Australia, but also of Australia’s social and cultural history. And yet, not all are well known and many lack published descriptions. The purpose of this workshop is to provide an opportunity to share information about existing language corpora in Australia, with a view to producing a special issue of the _Australian Journal of Linguistics_ that introduces a selection of these corpora, explores how they can contribute to our understanding of language, society, and history in Australia, and considers avenues that such corpora open up for future research.

**When**: Monday July 3 2023

**Length**: Full day

**Organisers**: Catherine Travis, Li Nguyen

#### Australian Text Analytics Platform: New tools for text analysis

The main means of delivery for ATAP is Jupyter notebooks and this half-day workshop began with a brief introduction to notebooks for participants not already familiar with the technology. The main body of the workshop introduced two tools made available by ATAP, and the session ended with a short summary of other tools being developed in recent work.

**When**: Monday June 19 2023

**Length**: 3 hours

**Facilitators**: Simon Musgrave, Sam Hames, Ben Foley, Chao Sun

**More information**: This workshop was a satellite event of the 7th Conference of the International Society for the Linguistics of English (ISLE7) - see the [conference website](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/isle7) for further details.

#### Exploring Digital Text Collections with Juxtorpus: A Taster Webinar on the Latest ATAP Text Analysis Tool

Join us for a hybrid taster webinar on the latest addition to the suite of ATAP text analysis tools - Juxtorpus. Developed to provide a unified framework for managing and exploring text contents and metadata, Juxtorpus offers a Corpus package that enables flexible building, exploration, and slicing of your corpus while maintaining its shape, and a Jux package that allows for easy comparison and highlighting of differences between any two corpora with tools and visualisations that come off-the-shelf. During the webinar, we'll also show you how to use other ATAP tools in combination with the Corpus to create a reusable workflow that will boost your analysis capabilities.

This 1.5-hour webinar will come with minimal hands-on opportunities, and we invite anyone interested in learning how to handle and analyse their digital text collections to join us. No programming knowledge or skills are required.

**When**: Thursday, 25th May 2023

**Length**: 90 minutes

**Facilitator**: Chao Sun

#### Jefferson Transcript Search Tool

The Search Tool project uses programming to explore how to easily search and manipulate transcripts without the need to 'clean' the transcript. A browser-based tool has been developed, designed to be used by researchers unfamiliar with programming.

The workshop was presented by Evelyn Ansell and is an outcome of her Career Development placement with Australia's Academic and Research Network ([AARNET](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/)). The Jupyter Notebook tool and this workshop have been developed during that placement.

**Date**: Friday 17 March 2023

**Length**: 90 minutes

**Facilitator**: Evelyn Ansell

#### A hands-on guide to Semantic Tagger for your text data analysis

The Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) project is a project that aims to provide researchers with the tools and training for analysing, processing, and exploring text. As part of this project, we have adapted with permission, a Semantic Tagger, developed by the University Centre for Computer Corpus Research on Language ([UCREL](https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/)) at Lancaster University. This tool uses the Python Multilingual UCREL Semantic Analysis System ([PyMUSAS](https://pypi.org/project/pymusas/)) to tag your text data so that you can extract token level semantic tags from your text. In addition to the USAS tags, this tool can also recognize Multi Word Expressions (MWE), i.e., expressions formed by two or more words that behave like a unit such as 'South Australia', and identifies lemmas and Part-of-Speech (POS) tags in the text. For example, in the sentence ‘President Joe Biden attended two meetings today’, the tool will tag each token with its semantic tag like this -> ‘President Joe Biden’: MWE of [Personal names], ‘attended’: [Participating], ‘two’: [Number], ‘meetings’: [Participating] and ‘today’: [Time: Present; simultaneous]. This tool is available in both English and multi-lingual (Chinese, Italian and Spanish) versions and supports saving the results locally for further analysis, enabling you to gain meaningful insights into your research questions.

**Date**: Wednesday 22 March 2023

**Length**: 90 minutes

#### Australian Text Analytics Platform tools: Discursis, Juxtorpus, Quotation tool and Semantic tagger

This workshop was part of the USyd Digital Humanities Day 2023.

The workshop demonstrated and taught several recently or soon-to-be-released tools from the ATAP text analytic tool collection. These tools include Discursis for analysing human conversational texts, Juxtorpus for advanced corpus slicing and comparison, Semantic Tagger for semantically tagging every word in your text collections, and Quotation Tool for NLP algorithm-based quotation extraction, analysis, and visualisation.

**Date**: Tuesday 14 March 2023

**Length**: 3 hours

#### HASS Research Data Commons and IRC Computational Skills Summer School

The Australian Research Data Commons ([ARDC](https://www.ardc.edu.au)) through the HASS Research Data Commons and Indigenous Research Capability (HASS RDC and IRC Program) offered a Computational Skills Summer School in Sydney, February 7 and 8, 2023.

The Summer School featured skills development workshops to help researchers use the research infrastructure that is being created in the HASS RDC and IRC Program.

The projects from the HASS RDC and IRC Program presented workshops on using the tools and platforms.

#### Pre-conference workshop (before the 2022 Conference of the Australian Linguistic Society)

The Australian Text Analytics Platform and the [Language Data Commons of Australia](https://www.ldaca.edu.au/) presented a day of workshop activities to give ALS conference delegates (and anyone else who is interested) the opportunity to learn more about the work of the two projects. The day included:

- an overview of the projects and the work to date
- reports on specific sub-projects
- introductory workshops on the tools and resources being developed
- a workshop on using Discursis, a tool for tracking topics in interactive use of language
- the opportunity to influence future work by exploring and providing feedback on the data interface which we are building.
