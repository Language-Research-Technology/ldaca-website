# International Organisations {#international-organisations}

- Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure ([CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/)) is a research infrastructure that was initiated from the vision that all digital language resources and tools from all over Europe and beyond are accessible through an online environment for the support of researchers in the humanities and social sciences.

LDC was formed in 1992 to address the critical data shortage then facing language technology research and development. Initially, LDC's primary role was as a repository and distribution point for language resources. but with the help of its members, LDC has grown into an organization that creates and distributes a wide array of language resources.

# Publications {#publications}

- [The Open Handbook of Linguistic Data Management](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/5244/The-Open-Handbook-of-Linguistic-Data-Management)
  Edited by Andrea L. Berez-Kroeker, Bradley McDonnell, Eve Koller, Lauren B. Collister. MIT Press 2022.

  "A guide to principles and methods for the management, archiving, sharing, and citing of linguistic research data, especially digital data. “Doing language science” depends on collecting, transcribing, annotating, analyzing, storing, and sharing linguistic research data. This volume offers a guide to linguistic data management, engaging with current trends toward the transformation of linguistics into a more data-driven and reproducible scientific endeavor. It offers both principles and methods, presenting the conceptual foundations of linguistic data management and a series of case studies, each of which demonstrates a concrete application of abstract principles in a current practice."

  This material is Open Access.
