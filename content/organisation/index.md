LDaCA is one strand of the partnership between the Australian Research Data Commons ([ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/)) and the [School of Languages and Cultures](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/) at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/). This partnership includes a number of projects that explore language-related technologies, data collection infrastructure and Indigenous capability programs. These projects are being led out of the Language Technology and Data Analytics Lab ([LADAL](https://slcladal.github.io/index.html)), which is overseen by [Professor Michael Haugh](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/1498/michael-haugh) and [Dr Martin Schweinberger](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/4295/martin-schweinberger).

The LDaCA project received investment from ARDC through two of its programs:

1. Australian Data Partnerships Program: Developing policy and technology foundations of a nationally integrated research infrastructure for language data collections of high strategic importance for the Australian research community ([DP](https://ardc.edu.au/project/language-data-commons-of-australia-ldaca/)).
2. HASS Research Data Commons and Indigenous Research Capability Program: Capitalising on existing infrastructure, securing vulnerable and dispersed collections and linking with improved analysis environments for new research outcomes ([HASS-RDC](https://ardc.edu.au/news/announcing-3-successful-projects-ardc-hass-rdc/)).
