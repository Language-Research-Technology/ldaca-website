<br>

{{< glossary_link display="LDaCA" id="ldaca" >}} has begun adding datasets, including:

- most of the datasets which were part of the Australian National Corpus {{< glossary_link display="collection" id="collection" >}}, now available at our [data portal](https://data.ldaca.edu.au/search) (or click the **Data Portal** button top right).

<br>

### A Corpus of Oz Early English ([COOEE](https://data.ldaca.edu.au/collection?id=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Chdl10.26180~23961609&_crateId=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Chdl10.26180~23961609))

A collection of texts written in Australia between 1788 and 1900. The corpus is divided into four time periods (1788–1825, 1826–1850, 1851–1875 and 1876–1900) each holding about 500,000 words. Four registers were defined for [COOEE](https://varieng.helsinki.fi/CoRD/corpora/COOEE/basic.html): the Speech-based Register (SB), the Private Written Register (PrW), the Public Written Register (PcW) and the register of Government English (GE). For each time period, there is a similar number of words in the different registers.

The Australian Corpus of English (ACE) was compiled to match Australian data from 1986 with the American (Brown) and British (LOB) corpora of written English from the 1960s. It includes 500 samples of published texts taken from 15 different categories of nonfiction and fiction, including newspapers, reportage, editorials, reviews; magazines and journals: popular, academic; government and corporate documents; fiction monographs and short stories (both popular and literary).

The Australian component of the [International Corpus of English](http://ice-corpora.net/ice/index.html) (ICE-AUS) is an approximately one million word corpus of transcribed spoken and written Australian English from 1992-1995. It consists of 500 samples of Australian English (60% speech, 40% writing) that match the structure of other corpora associated with the International Corpus of English.

### [The La Trobe Corpus of Spoken Australian English](https://data.ldaca.edu.au/collection?id=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Cdoi10.26181%252F23089559&_crateId=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Cdoi10.26181%252F23089559)

### [The speech of Australian adolescents: research data and recordings collected by A.G. Mitchell and Arthur Delbridge in 1959 and 1960](https://data.ldaca.edu.au/collection?id=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Cdoi10.25910%252Fjkwy-wk76&_crateId=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Cdoi10.25910%252Fjkwy-wk76)

This dataset comprises 22,187 recordings of Australian English as spoken by 7,736 students at 330 schools across Australia and specific information about the speakers. The recordings were made on reel-to-reel tapes and were used to create the 1965 monograph _The speech of Australian adolescents: a survey_ and the revised 1965 publication _The pronunciation of English in Australia_ (originally published in 1946). The Australian National Corpus provided access to a sample of this material; the full dataset is now available.

**Other datasets not yet available in the portal:**

- [Sydney Speaks](https://data.ldaca.edu.au/collection?id=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Chdl10.25911~m03c-yz22&_crateId=arcp%3A%2F%2Fname%2Chdl10.25911~m03c-yz22): This project seeks to document and explore Australian English, as spoken in Australia’s largest and most ethnically and linguistically diverse city – Sydney.
- [From Farms to Freeways](http://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/): This research project sought to analyse the experiences of women who had lived in the Blacktown and Penrith areas since the early 1950s, including their responses to social changes brought about by rapid suburbanisation in the Western Sydney region in the post-war period. Two-hour taped discussions were held with 34 women, aged 60 and over, who were in their early twenties during the Western Sydney region's population growth.
- A collection of government documents in various languages. This is a very small dataset assembled to check that our technology can handle different languages and different scripts; more information about this work is available in [this presentation](https://ptsefton.com/2022/01/27/DAMTA_Slides_v1/index.html).

Work is underway to make data from other earlier projects accessible through LDaCA:
