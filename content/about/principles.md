The Language Data Commons of Australia aims to ensure long-term access to language {{< glossary_link display="data collections" id="data-collection" >}} for analysis and reuse. Sustainable management of and access to these significant collections of intangible cultural heritage are underpinned by two sets of complementary guiding principles of data management and stewardship, namely the {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}} and {{< glossary_link display="CARE" id="care" >}} principles.

<br>

## FAIR Principles

The {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}} principles were [first published](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) by a group of stakeholders representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers. The principles aim to address issues surrounding data management and stewardship, focusing on four areas (which provide the {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}} acronym).
<br />

### Findable

Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Making the data findable includes:

- (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
- Data are described with rich metadata
- Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they
  describe
- (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
  <br />

### Accessible

Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

- (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
  - The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
  - The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
- Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
  <br />

### Interoperable

The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

- (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation
- (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}} principles
- (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
  <br />

### Reusable

The ultimate goal of {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}} is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

- (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
  - (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
  - (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
  - (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

<br>

The Australian Research Data Commons ({{< glossary_link display="ARDC" id="ardc" >}}) and LDaCA support {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}} data practices and initiatives that make data and related research outputs {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}}. At the same time, the {{< glossary_link display="ARDC" id="ardc" >}} and LDaCA acknowledge that the implementation of the principles will look different across disciplines and will need discipline-specific approaches and standards.

<br>

## CARE Principles

The [CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://www.gida-global.org/care) were developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA); they are a response to the {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}} principles and aim to complement them. GIDA highlights how the {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}} principles and the open data movement focus on increasing data sharing among researchers and entities but do not take into account power differentials and historical contexts or fully engage with Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests. These include the rights to generate value from Indigenous data in ways that are grounded in Indigenous worldviews and to advance Indigenous innovation and self-determination. The {{< glossary_link display="CARE" id="care" >}} Principles also focus on four areas.
<br />

### Collective Benefit

Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.

- For inclusive development and innovation
- For improved government and citizen engagement
- For equitable outcomes
  <br />

### Authority to control

Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered.

- Recognizing rights and interests
- Data for governance
- Governance of data
  <br />

### Responsibility

Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit.

- For positive relationships
- For expanding capability and capacity
- For Indigenous languages and worldviews
  <br />

### Ethics

Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.

- For minimizing harm and maximizing benefit
- For justice
- For future use

<br>

The Australian Research Data Commons ({{< glossary_link display="ARDC" id="ardc" >}}) and LDaCA support the {{< glossary_link display="CARE" id="care" >}} principles to further extend data management principles, ensuring that Indigenous communities benefit from the data, and that authority to control Indigenous data is held by Indigenous Peoples. We have a responsibility to share how data is used to collectively benefit Indigenous Peoples, and that Indigenous Peoples' rights and wellbeing are the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle.
