LDaCA ran a Graduate Digital Research Fellowship program in [2023](../gdrf/) and [2024](../gdrf-2024/). The program ran again in 2025 and was again co-ordinated by Simon Musgrave and Sam Hames. Simon and Sam made two changes to the organisation of the program in 2025 which were intended to make it possible for the program to expand, especially in future years. The two changes were:
- The program was run entirely online. In previous years, face-to-face activities were part of the program, and this limited the pool of potential participants to people in South East Queensland. This move was intended to open the program to participants from anywhere in Australia, a goal which was met with one participant joining us from Sydney and another from Perth (and posing a scheduling challenge!).
- Discussions with organisations with which LDaCA collaborates provided possibilities for enlarging the pool of experts who could act as mentors in the program. These discussions included the [Digital Observatory](https://www.digitalobservatory.net.au/) team at Queensland University of Technology and the [Melbourne Data Analytics Platform](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/mdap) at The University of Melbourne, although in the end only assistance from Digital Observatory was called on.  Robert Fleet from the Digital Observatory was a mentor in the program this year, and we thank him for his contribution.

The program supports a small group of research students to explore the possibilities of digital scholarship, particularly in HASS. Our Fellows are students undertaking extended research projects who spent 12–15 weeks learning about digital and computational skills in order to enhance their current research/thesis topic or to work on an independent digital project. The Fellows met regularly in activities to develop a sound understanding of digital research methods and tools, including seminars and training workshops. They also had access to mentors who advised and collaborated on their digital projects.

Our three Graduate Digital Research Fellows in 2025 were:

**Elaine Yan Li**: Just before joining our program, Elaine submitted her PhD thesis at The University of Sydney. The thesis looked at questions around how second language learners develop knowledge of vocabulary in the language which they are learning, and how that knowledge can be assessed. A substantial portion of the research used quantitative methods, and Elaine was keen to improve her skills in working with such data using statistical analysis packages. She was especially keen to look at ways to explore and present data using effective visualisations. Elaine was the participant who benefitted from our association with the Digital Observatory, having Robert Fleet as her mentor.

Elaine said, “This mentorship is very useful for you to explore your own data, your own research fields. I have no experience in coding. Robert was really encouraging and helped me try out some quantitative methods”

**Alex Stephenson**: Alex is a PhD candidate at the University of Western Australia. His research is multidisciplinary, including aspects of linguistics, archaeology and heritage studies, and looks at the post-digitisation future of heritage materials held by language centres in Western Australia. For the GDRF program, Alex focused on what sustainable data management practices for digital data (particularly language data) might look like, given the special circumstances of language centres. Ben Foley mentored Alex, contributing his expertise and time with great generosity, and the work was of such mutual interest that their discussions have continued beyond the period of the fellowship program.

Alex said, “Prior to the GDRF program, I felt that while my research explores the social aspect of post-digitisation, I was somewhat lacking in the more practical hands-on side of things. I learned so much in my mentor meetings with Ben that has given me not only a stronger understanding of these practical issues, but also how to approach them in different contexts. I also really enjoyed meeting with the GDRF team and discussing many aspects of digital research that I had never thought about before. This was a super supportive environment to explore these digital issues and I’d highly recommend anyone to participate in this program.”

**Oscar Toohey**: Oscar joined the program in a gap between completing a masters degree by research and commencing a PhD at Griffith University. His research looks at how hospitality industry staff negotiate the relationship between hospitality service and alcohol policy. Before embarking on the PhD journey, Oscar was keen to gain some knowledge about how to work with policy documents, especially to explore the extent to which text analytic tools might be an aid to such research. But we have come to expect that initial plans are open to change in our program. What Oscar actually ended up doing, aided by his mentor Sam, was consider what he might be looking for in the data he was examining. The answer to this question implied structures of knowledge contained in the data and Oscar also considered how such structures might be represented.

Oscar said at the end of the GDRF program, “I have learned to navigate big data sets much more easily, so now I feel like I can offer much better contributions to existing work with my qualitative methods…The way I approach my PhD will be extremely different. I feel like my PhD will be a lot more collaborative now.”

As in previous years, Sam and Simon were excited to take part in intensive discussions about different kinds of data and different methodological approaches to data, and to interact with a group of very talented researchers.

The GDRF program will run again in 2026, and again, LDaCA is hoping to attract participants from across the country.
