As detailed in an [earlier](../gdrf/) post, we ran a Graduate Digital Research Fellowship program in 2023 under the auspices of the Australian Text Analytics Program ([ATAP](https://www.atap.edu.au)). The program ran again in 2024, under the LDaCA banner with three students participating and with {{< profile id = "hames" >}} and {{< profile id = "musgrave" >}} co-ordinating the activity.

The program supports research students to explore the possibilities of digital scholarship, particularly in {{< glossary_link display="HASS" id="hass" >}}. Our Fellows are students undertaking extended research projects who spent 12-15 weeks learning about digital and computational skills in order to enhance their current research/thesis topic or to work on an independent digital project. They explored digital research methods in areas including

- Computational analysis of text
- Analysis of digital images
- Automatic speech recognition (and automatic non-speech recognition)

The Fellows met regularly in activities to develop a sound understanding of digital research methods and tools, including seminars and training workshops. They also had access to mentors who advised and collaborated on their digital projects.

The three Fellows who participated in the 2024 program and their projects were:
<br>

## David Gilchrist (UQ, Journalism):

David's research looks at how journalists connect with their audiences, particularly in local and hyper-local contexts. In the Fellowship program, David focused on two areas:

- how to collect and curate material published online
- whether there was a place for [sentiment analysis](https://www.atap.edu.au/text-analysis/methods/#classification) in his methodology.

More abstractly, the questions which David was addressing were about how to integrate computational methods into a qualitative enquiry, and (not surprisingly!) we had some fascinating discussions with David about possible answers to such questions.

## Lu Jin (UQ, Architecture, Design and Planning ):

Lu is researching food production in urban spaces as a planning issue. A preliminary step in her work is to be able to assess the amount and diversity of vegetation in the city and her work as a Fellow explored possible methods of analysing digital images which could make this task easy and quick. She used images captured on a phone and then experimented with different image analysis algorithms to see which ones best identified greenery and its boundaries. The experiments showed that relatively simple approaches worked quite well, but further work is needed to decide whether the results will be useful for large scale surveys of urban environments.

## Quy Pham (UQ, Applied Linguistics):

Quy is studying errors in the spoken language produced by people learning English as a foreign language. He is using a large corpus of material produced by learners of English in 10 countries and areas in Asia, [ICNALE: The International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English](https://language.sakura.ne.jp/icnale/). One phenomenon which might relate to errors is pausing, and Quy was therefore interested to explore the possibilities of automatically identifying pauses in recordings of speech. Building from this, he also looked at whether it was possible to automatically tag the start of specific tasks within a controlled interaction (spoiler alert: not really).

A GDRF program will be offered again in 2025 by the Language Data Commons of Australia. If you think the program could benefit you, there is an [online form](https://forms.gle/prTfh5hpMWhT8wkW9) for expressions of interest (due by **SOME DATE**). For further information, you can contact [Sam Hames](mailto:sam.hames@uq.edu.au) or [Simon Musgrave](mailto:s.musgrave@uq.edu.au).
