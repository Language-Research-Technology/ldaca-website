### Forthcoming workshops {#forthcoming-workshops}

#### HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons Computational Skills Summer School 2024

The 2024 HASS and Indigenous RDC Computational Skills Summer School aims to empower participants with practical knowledge, build digital skills, and help inspire new research outcomes within these research communities.

Participation is aimed at researchers in the humanities, arts, social sciences and Indigenous fields of study. Themed streams will explore geosocial and geospatial data applications in humanities, arts, social sciences, and Indigenous research, using ARDC tools and services. You’ll gain experience through seminars and workshops and will be guided through hands-on use of free tools and platforms provided by the ARDC and its partners.

For the ARDC Summer School, IDN and LDaCA will lead a stream on the governance, management and usage of data, especially Indigenous data.

- A series of seminars will focus on sustainability, storage, usability and description of data.
- A case study will highlight how data is being managed for long-term access
- A hands-on session will use Python code notebooks to analyse data.

The case study and hands-on session will focus on geospatial aspects of data. Prior coding knowledge is not required for the hands-on session.

**When**: 7-9 February 2024

**Where**: Naarm/Melbourne, Monash University Caulfield Campus

**Where**: On campus, ANU

**Abstract submission**:

We welcome papers from linguistics and other disciplines. Abstracts should be of 250-300 words (excluding references) either in English, or in a community language with English translation and should include:

- Description of the language data (e.g. sociolinguistic corpora, oral histories, written collections, etc.), and the relevant community/communities
- Questions that this data has allowed us to probe and answers that have come out of it, e.g.:
  - immigrant language practice patterns, both for community languages and their English varieties
  - immigrant contemporary language use and its relationship with culture, society and politics in Australia
  - the discourse and policies around Australian immigrant languages
  - immigrant community formation in Australian society
  - immigrant voice in the history of Australia

Submit your abstract to: https://forms.gle/bH8aHxkVxsV4cTEM8 by **3 October 2023** (notification of acceptance: 17 October 2023)

**Organisers**: [Li Nguyen](mailto:li.nguyen@anu.edu.au) & Catherine Travis

### Previous Webinars {#webinars}

Our webinar series is a joint initiative with the Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory ([LADAL](https://slcladal.github.io/index.html)), (School of Languages and Cultures, The University of Queensland).

#### October 3 2022 - Paweł Kamocki: European Union Data Protection initiatives and their consequences for research

**Abstract**:<br>
The European Union, with its large population and GDP, is a leading force in regulatory globalisation. This webinar will discuss recent developments in legal frameworks affecting research data in Europe. Apart from the General Data Protection Regulation which, since its entry into application in 2018, has become an international standard of personal data protection, the recent introduction of statutory copyright exceptions for Text and Data Mining will also be discussed. Moreover, the webinar will also include a presentation of the most recent changes in EU law, such as the Data Governance Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act, which are expected to enter into application in the coming years.

**Paweł Kamocki** is a legal expert in Leibniz-Institut für Deutsche Sprache, Mannheim. He studied linguistics and law, and in 2017 obtained his doctorate in law from the universities of Paris and Münster for a thesis on legal aspects of data-intensive university research, with a focus on Knowledge Commons. He worked as a research and teaching assistant at the Paris Descartes university (now: Université de Paris), then also in the private sector. He is certified to work as an attorney in France. An active member of the [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) community since 2012, he currently chairs the CLARIN Legal and Ethical Issues Committee. He also worked with other projects and initiatives in the field of research data policy (RDA, EUDAT) and co-created several LegalTech tools for researchers. One of his main research interests are legal issues in Machine Translation.

#### August 1 2022 - Václav Cvrček: The Czech national Corpus

[Václav Cvrček](https://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/en/institute/people/vaclav-cvrcek-2/) is a linguist who deals with the description of the Czech language, especially with the use of large electronic corpora and quantitative methods. In 2013-2016 he worked as the director of the [Czech National Corpus](https://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/en/) project, since 2016 he has been the deputy director. Recently, he has been focusing on research on textual variability and corpus-based discourse analysis with a focus on online media.

#### June 6 2022 - Barbara McGillivray: The _Journal of Open Humanities Data_

Barbara McGillivray is a Turing Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and Editor in Chief of the [Journal of Open Humanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/). Since September 2021 she is also a lecturer in Digital Humanities and Cultural Computation at the [Department of Digital Humanities of King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh). Before joining the Turing, she was language technologist in the Dictionary division of Oxford University Press and data scientist in the Open Research Group of Springer Nature. Her research at the Turing is on how words change meaning over time and how to model this change in computational ways. She works on machine-learning models for the change in meaning of words in historical times (Ancient Greek, Latin, eighteen-century English) and in contemporary texts (Twitter, web archives, emoji). Her interdisciplinary contribution covers Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Historical Linguistics and other humanistic fields, to push the boundaries of what academic disciplines separately have achieved so far on this topic.

#### 4 April 2022 - Keoni Mahelona: A practical approach to Indigenous data sovereignty

Keoni Mahelona is the Chief Technical Officer of [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz/) where he is a part of the team developing the Kaitiakitanga Licence. This licence seeks to balance the importance of publicly accessible data with the reality that Indigenous Peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public data. By simply opening access to data and knowledge, Indigenous Peoples could be further colonised and taken advantage of in a digital, modern world. Therefore Keoni is committed to devising data governance regimes which enable Indigenous Peoples to reclaim and maintain sovereignty over Indigenous data.

### Advice for researchers {#advice}

LDaCA has previously run regular online office hours, jointly hosted with the [Digital Observatory](https://research.qut.edu.au/digitalobservatory/) (DO). This activity will not continue in 2024, but LDaCA and DO are developing an alternative model to help Australian researchers working with linguistics, text analytics, digital and computational methods, social media and web archives.

In the meantime, you are welcome to contact us by [email](mailto:ldaca@uq.edu.au) at ldaca@uq.edu.au with your technical questions, research problems and rough ideas to get advice and feedback from the combined expertise of our ARDC research infrastructure projects. No question is too small, and even if we don’t know the answer we are likely to be able to point you to someone who does.
