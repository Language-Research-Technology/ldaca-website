### Indigenous Data Governance: A discussion

#### Part of The University of Queensland Research and Innovation Week 2024

The University of Queensland is committed to growing the opportunities for Indigenous people to lead and conduct their own research. One important strand in developing this innovative research culture is ensuring that appropriate governance is in place for Indigenous data.

This event will present a panel of Indigenous researchers, data custodians and data stewards discussing current developments in this field including:

- the importance of Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property concerns
- governance of Indigenous Data Framework for the HASS & Indigenous Research Data Commons
- tools and methods for data governance.

**Panellists**: {{< profile id="barrowcliffe" >}}, {{< profile id="mclellan" >}}, {{< profile id="acres" >}}. The discussion will be facilitated by Grant Sarra.

**When**: 4–6pm, 30 September 2024

**Where**: Anthropology Museum, Michie Building, The University of Queensland (St Lucia Campus)

### Using Hansard & Other Parliamentary Proceedings for Your Research

Parliamentary bodies around the world have been publishing transcriptions of their proceedings for decades or even centuries. These transcriptions enable public scrutiny and transparency of the actions and speech of legislative bodies and elected representatives. Because of their documentation of legislative action and speech, their relatively consistent format, and their coverages of long periods of time they are potentially useful for policy researchers, media and communication scholars, political scientists, linguists, sociologists, historians, and many others.

This workshop aims to provide a starting point for working with these transcribed proceedings, including evaluating how it might (and might not!) be useful for your research, how to get started for different kinds of projects, and cautionary notes on potential limitations. We will be using a suite of computational text analysis approaches, with no prior coding experience necessary.

We will include an overview of different proceedings around the world, the variety of different access mechanisms, pre-collected datasets, and different ways you can work with Hansards. Guest presenters from different fields will showcase their research. In the second half of the workshop we will run an interactive session on working with the proceedings of the Australian Federal Parliament.

**Leaders**: {{< profile id="hames" >}}, {{< profile id="musgrave" >}}

**When**: 19 September 2024, 10am—1pm

**Where**: RD Watt Building (A04), Seminar Room 203, The University of Sydney

### Data Migration Skills Workshop

The Language Data Commons of Australia infrastructure is based on widely-accepted standards such as [Research Object Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) and the [Oxford Common File Layout](https://ocfl.io/). The project has been running for more than three years and the processes and tools for aligning data with these standards are now well-developed. This workshop aims to show the application of those tools to data in a variety of formats to efficiently migrate material to the LDaCA standards.

The hands-on workshop is intended for data librarians and other professionals who are interested in these issues, but participation is open to anyone who is prepared to work on language data. Participants will have some experience of working with code and/or metadata and will commit to bringing datasets which they work with (or are responsible for) to use in the practical exercises which will make up a large part of the workshop. We will also have example datasets available and we also are open to the possibility of participants working in teams based on complementary skills.

        <b>Workshop on community language corpora in Australia</b>
    </summary>
    <p>Australia is a highly multilingual and multicultural society, with more than 490 languages coming from around 300 ancestries and cultural traditions (ABS, 2021, 2022). For decades, the language and cultural maintenance of various immigrant groups have been under investigation by many scholars, not only in linguistics but also in history, sociology, anthropology, and other disciplines. This work has amassed a large body of data reflecting the languages of these communities, providing information about how Australia’s immigration history has contributed to the country today.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this workshop is to bring together scholars working with language corpora from across different disciplines. The workshop is being run as part of the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA), which is working to build national research infrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences, facilitating sustainable access to and controlled use of digital language corpora for linguists, scholars across the Humanities and Social Sciences, and non-academics.</p>
    <p>The workshop will consist of presentations on language data collected from Australian immigrant communities for different research purposes, and will close with a panel discussion on needs and challenges around managing and archiving community language data in a way that is ethical, legal and culturally sensitive, and how LDaCA can help support that.</p>

        <b>Workshop on Language Corpora in Australia</b>
    </summary>
    <p>Over decades of work in Australia, significant {{< glossary_link display="collections" id="collection">}} of language data have been amassed, including of varieties of Australian English, Australian migrant languages, Australian Indigenous languages, sign languages and others. These collections represent a trove of knowledge not only of language in Australia, but also of Australia’s social and cultural history. And yet, not all are well known and many lack published descriptions. The purpose of this workshop is to provide an opportunity to share information about existing language corpora in Australia, with a view to producing a special issue of the _Australian Journal of Linguistics_ that introduces a selection of these corpora, explores how they can contribute to our understanding of language, society, and history in Australia, and considers avenues that such corpora open up for future research.</p>

        <b>A hands-on guide to Semantic Tagger for your text data analysis</b>
    </summary>
    <p>The Australian Text Analytics Platform ({{< glossary_link display="ATAP" id="atap">}}) project is a project that aims to provide researchers with the tools and training for analysing, processing, and exploring text. As part of this project, we have adapted with permission, a Semantic Tagger, developed by the University Centre for Computer Corpus Research on Language (<a href="https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UCREL</a>) at Lancaster University. This tool uses the {{< glossary_link display="Python" id="python">}} Multilingual UCREL Semantic Analysis System <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pymusas/" target="_blank">PyMUSAS</a>) to tag your text data so that you can extract token level semantic tags from your text. In addition to the USAS tags, this tool can also recognise Multi Word Expressions (MWE), i.e. expressions formed by two or more words that behave like a unit such as 'South Australia', and identifies lemmas and Part-of-Speech (POS) tags in the text. For example, in the sentence ‘President Joe Biden attended two meetings today’, the tool will tag each token with its semantic tag like this -> ‘President Joe Biden’: MWE of [Personal names], ‘attended’: [Participating], ‘two’: [Number], ‘meetings’: [Participating] and ‘today’: [Time: Present; simultaneous]. This tool is available in both English and multi-lingual (Chinese, Italian and Spanish) versions and supports saving the results locally for further analysis, enabling you to gain meaningful insights into your research questions.</p>

            <b>October 3 2022 - Paweł Kamocki: European Union Data Protection initiatives and their consequences for research</b>
        </summary>
        <p>The European Union, with its large population and GDP, is a leading force in regulatory globalisation. This webinar will discuss recent developments in legal frameworks affecting research data in Europe. Apart from the General Data Protection Regulation which, since its entry into application in 2018, has become an international standard of personal data protection, the recent introduction of statutory {{< glossary_link display="copyright" id="copyright">}} exceptions for Text and Data Mining will also be discussed. Moreover, the webinar will also include a presentation of the most recent changes in EU law, such as the Data Governance Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act, which are expected to enter into application in the coming years.</p>
        <p><b>Paweł Kamocki</b> is a legal expert in Leibniz-Institut für Deutsche Sprache, Mannheim. He studied linguistics and law, and in 2017 obtained his doctorate in law from the universities of Paris and Münster for a thesis on legal aspects of data-intensive university research, with a focus on Knowledge Commons.

            <b>June 6 2022 - Barbara McGillivray: The <i>Journal of Open Humanities Data</i></b>
        </summary>
        <p><b>Barbara McGillivray</b> is a Turing Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/" target="_blank">The Alan Turing Institute</a>, and Editor in Chief of the <a href="https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/" target="_blank">Journal of Open Humanities Data</a>. Since September 2021 she is also a lecturer in Digital Humanities and Cultural Computation at the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh" target="_blank">Department of Digital Humanities of King's College London</a>. Before joining the Turing, she was language technologist in the Dictionary division of Oxford University Press and data scientist in the Open Research Group of Springer Nature. Her research at the Turing is on how words change meaning over time and how to model this change in computational ways. She works on machine-learning models for the change in meaning of words in historical times (Ancient Greek, Latin, eighteen-century English) and in contemporary texts (Twitter, web archives, emoji). Her interdisciplinary contribution covers Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Historical Linguistics and other humanistic fields, to push the boundaries of what academic disciplines separately have achieved so far on this topic.</p>

            <b>4 April 2022 - Keoni Mahelona: A practical approach to Indigenous data sovereignty</b>
        </summary>
        <p><b>Keoni Mahelona</b> is the Chief Technical Officer of <a href="https://tehiku.nz/" target="_blank">Te Hiku Media</a> where he is a part of the team developing the Kaitiakitanga Licence. This licence seeks to balance the importance of publicly accessible data with the reality that Indigenous Peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public data. By simply opening access to data and knowledge, Indigenous Peoples could be further colonised and taken advantage of in a digital, modern world. Therefore Keoni is committed to devising {{< glossary_link display="data governance" id="data-governance">}} regimes which enable Indigenous Peoples to reclaim and maintain sovereignty over Indigenous data.</p>

### Australian Digital Observatory Online Office Hours

LDaCA has previously run regular online office hours, jointly hosted with the Australian Digital Observatory ({{< glossary_link display="ADO" id="ado" >}}). This activity will not continue in 2024, but LDaCA and {{< glossary_link display="ADO" id="ado" >}} are developing an alternative model to help Australian researchers working with linguistics, text analytics, digital and computational methods, social media and web archives.

In the meantime, you are welcome to contact us by email at [ldaca@uq.edu.au](mailto:ldaca@uq.edu.au) with your technical questions, research problems and rough ideas to get advice and feedback from the combined expertise of our {{< glossary_link display="ARDC" id="ardc" >}} research infrastructure projects. No question is too small, and even if we don’t know the answer we are likely to be able to point you to someone who does.
