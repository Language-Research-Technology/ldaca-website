## Indigenous Languages of Australia

<br>

### [50 Words Project](https://50words.online/)

Showcases words from 64 languages across Australia, with further languages being added regularly as more communities around Australia become involved. For each language, you can hear the words spoken via a map that shows the general location of the language.

<br>

Provides a controlled vocabulary of persistent identifiers, a thesaurus of languages and peoples, and information about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages which has been assembled from referenced sources.

An online resource created to improve public access to audio recordings, held in the Fryer Library (UQ), of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people speaking Indigenous languages of Queensland. The project aims to make the recordings as openly available as possible so they can be used to assist communities with language recovery and education, and deepen knowledge of First Nations languages. A map summary and table of languages is also available for browsing, based on recordings from three academics: Elwyn Flint, Bruce Rigsby and Bruce Sommer.

<br>

### [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/)

Provides information about the languages of the world, but operates on a subscription model. The information that is available without a subscription is very limited: the first three lines of individual language entries which include the [ISO 639-3](/resources/ldaca-resources/metadata/#iso-639) code, the classification of the language into a language family, and a link to the language’s <GlossaryLink display="OLAC" id="olac" /> page.

<br>

### [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/)

Comprehensive reference information for the world's languages, especially the lesser-known languages. <GlossaryLink display="LDaCA" id="ldaca" /> uses <GlossaryLink display="Glottolog" id="glottolog" /> [language codes](/resources/ldaca-resources/metadata/#glottolog) in our <GlossaryLink display="metadata" id="metadata" />.

<br>

### [Open Language Archives Community (OLAC)](http://www.language-archives.org/)

An international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by:
  
(i) developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of language resources, and
  
(ii) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources.
  
<GlossaryLink display="OLAC" id="olac" /> harvests metadata and their website has a search facility to find resources for languages. <GlossaryLink display="OLAC" id="olac" /> [metadata recommendations](/resources/ldaca-resources/metadata/#olac) are the basis for some of LDaCA's metadata.

<br>

### [World Atlas of Linguistic Structures Online (WALS)](https://wals.info/)

A large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors.
