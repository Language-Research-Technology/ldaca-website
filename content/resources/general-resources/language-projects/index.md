## Indigenous Languages of Australia

<br>

### [First Languages Australia](https://www.firstlanguages.org.au/)

Encourages communication between communities, the government and key partners whose work can impact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages.

<br>

### [Living Languages](https://www.livinglanguages.org.au/)
  
Provides grassroots training to people, communities and Language Centres in Australia doing language work on the ground in remote, regional and urban areas.

<br>

### [Language Centres](https://www.arts.gov.au/publications/ila-funded-indigenous-language-centres)

The Indigenous Languages and Arts (ILA) program currently supports a number of organisations, including a network of 20 language centres. A list of these centres is available from the above link in PDF or DOCX format.

<br>

### [AustLang](https://collection.aiatsis.gov.au/austlang/about)
  
Provides a controlled vocabulary of persistent identifiers, a thesaurus of languages and peoples, and information about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages which has been assembled from referenced sources.

<br>

### [Nyingarn](https://nyingarn.net/)
  
A platform for primary sources in Australian Indigenous languages.

<br>

### [Digital Daisy Bates](https://bates.org.au/)

A collection of over 23,000 pages of wordlists of Australian languages, originally recorded by Daisy Bates in the early 1900s, made up of the original questionnaires and around 4,000 pages of typescripts.

<br>

### [50 Words Project](https://50words.online/)

Showcases words from 64 languages across Australia, with further languages being added regularly as more communities around Australia become involved. For each language, you can hear the words spoken via a map that shows the general location of the language.

<br>

### [Gambay](https://www.gambay.com.au)

A map of Australia's first languages.

<br>

### [Australian Indigenous language collections](https://www.nla.gov.au/research-guides/indigenous-language-resources#)

A guide to materials held in the National Library of Australia, with links to similar resources at State Libraries.

<br>

### [Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages (LAAL)](https://livingarchive.cdu.edu.au/)

See [Language Archives](/resources/general-resources/language-archives/).

<br>

### [Contemporary and Historical Reconstruction in the Indigenous Languages of Australia (CHIRILA)](http://www.pamanyungan.net/chirila/) 

A lexical database (a database with words from different languages). Currently, there are about 780,000 words, from all over Australia, of which about 20% is publicly available.

<br>

## Languages of the World

<br>

### [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/)

Comprehensive reference information for the world's languages, especially the lesser-known languages. LDaCA uses Glottolog [language codes](/resources/ldaca-resources/metadata/#glottolog) in our metadata.

<br>

### [Open Language Archives Community (OLAC)](http://www.language-archives.org/)

An international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by:
  
(i) developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of language resources, and
  
(ii) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources.
  
OLAC harvests metadata and their website has a search facility to find resources for languages. OLAC [metadata recommendations](/resources/ldaca-resources/metadata/#olac) are the basis for some of LDaCA's metadata.

<br>

### [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/)

Provides information about the languages of the world, but operates on a subscription model. The information that is available without a subscription is very limited: the first three lines of individual language entries which include the [ISO 639-3](/resources/ldaca-resources/metadata/#iso-639) code, the classification of the language into a language family, and a link to the languageâ€™s OLAC page.

<br>

### [World Atlas of Linguistic Structures Online (WALS)](https://wals.info/)

A large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors.
