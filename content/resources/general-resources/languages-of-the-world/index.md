### [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/)

Comprehensive reference information for the world's languages, especially the lesser-known languages. LDaCA uses Glottolog [language codes](../resources/metadata/#glottolog) in our metadata.

<br>

### [Open Language Archives Community (OLAC)](http://www.language-archives.org/)

An international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by:
  
(i) developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of language resources, and
  
(ii) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources.
  
OLAC harvests metadata and their website has a search facility to find resources for languages. OLAC [metadata recommendations](../resources/metadata/#olac) are the basis for some of LDaCA's metadata.

<br>

### [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/)

Provides information about the languages of the world, but operates on a subscription model. The information that is available without a subscription is very limited: the first three lines of individual language entries which include the [ISO 639-3](/resources/metadata/#iso-639) code, the classification of the language into a language family, and a link to the languageâ€™s OLAC page.

<br>

### [World Atlas of Linguistic Structures Online (WALS)](https://wals.info/)

A large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors.
