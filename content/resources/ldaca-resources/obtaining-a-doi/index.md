## How do I get a DOI for my dataset?

<br>

1. Through the {{< glossary_link display="collection's" id="collection" >}} custodial organisation:

   - Identify the collection’s custodial organisation – a university or research organisation that funded, sponsored, published, approved, or has a current or historical stakeholder interest in the research project that collected the data.

   - In many cases, contacting the university library about getting a {{< glossary_link display="DOI" id="doi" >}} for a dataset is a good starting point. Alternatively, an enquiry may be made with the research repository of the custodial organisation regarding options for getting a {{< glossary_link display="DOI" id="doi" >}}.<br>
     An example of a collection {{< glossary_link display="DOI" id="doi" >}} obtained via the university library is Sydney Speaks at the Australian National University (ANU), which can be viewed here: [Sydney Speaks DOI landing page](https://datacommons.anu.edu.au/DataCommons/rest/display/anudc:6184?layout=def:display). The ANU Library administers and manages the landing pages for ANU {{< glossary_link display="DOIs" id="doi" >}}.

<br>

2. If the above does not suit the context of the dataset, and the dataset has not been published before, consider depositing it in a data repository like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), a multi-disciplinary open repository that automatically assigns a {{< glossary_link display="DOI" id="doi" >}} to uploaded datasets and publications and hosts landing pages. Zenodo is a proponent of {{< glossary_link display="FAIR" id="fair" >}} Principles and open science; however, it allows upload of data with different access levels: Open, Closed, Restricted, and Embargoed - read the [Zenodo General Policies](https://about.zenodo.org/policies/), [Terms of Use](https://about.zenodo.org/terms/), and [FAQs](https://help.zenodo.org/). The {{< glossary_link display="Zenodo" id="zenodo" >}} {{< glossary_link display="DOI" id="doi" >}} landing page can contain a link to point researchers to the data content in {{< glossary_link display="LDaCA" id="ldaca" >}}.

<br>

3. If unsure whether any of the above applies to your context, please [contact LDaCA](/contact) to discuss {{< glossary_link display="PIDs" id="pid" >}} for your data.
