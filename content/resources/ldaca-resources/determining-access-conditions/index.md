LDaCA recommends the following workflow to determine the {{< glossary_link display="access conditions" id="access-conditions" >}} to be outlined in the license. Examples of existing data access licenses can be found [here](/licenses/).

<br>

## Step 1: Consider access condition(s) for the entire collection

- Do the same {{< glossary_link display="access conditions" id="access-conditions" >}} apply to the entire collection?
  - __If yes__ → two licenses can be defined (one for metadata, one for the collection data).<br>
  Metadata is licensed with an open license in order to allow the user to find the collection through the LDaCA catalogue.
  - __If no__ → all of the ways the data can be accessed must be defined, with a license for each subset.

<br>

- Name the license(s).
- Complete the following steps 2-4 for each license.

<br>

## Step 2: Organise relevant materials

What material can be accessed with this license?
- The material can be organised in different ways:
  - Metadata vs. data
  - Formats, e.g. transcriptions vs. audio
  - List of files/speakers (based on a shared quality such as sensitive material, transcribed or non-anonymised material)

<br>

## Step 3: Define the license terms

- What conditions are included in the license?
  - Can data be shared?
  - Can data be modified?
  - What is the license duration?
- Provide a brief description of the license conditions (1-2 lines).
- List the correct citation for this material.

<br>

## Step 4: Determine authorisation level

What authorisation is required for users to access this license?
- __If none__ → all users can accept the click-through license and access the material.
- __If by invitation__ → only users invited by the {{< glossary_link display="Data Steward" id="data-steward" >}} can accept the license and access the data.
- __If by application__ → arrange a form or a document with requirements for users to fill in.

<br>

This information can be mapped out visually or listed in an Excel sheet with the following basic structure:

License | Step 1: Determine the number of separate licenses needed, and name the license | Step 2: Define the material | Step 3: List the license terms | Step 4: Describe the authorisation process, if applicable |
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | | | |
2 | | | |

## Options for access by application

Access by application can be managed in a number of formats:
- Integrated forms, e.g. set three key questions for users requesting access to the collection.
- PDF application form, i.e. provide a dynamic PDF form that the user can download, complete and re-upload.
- Document upload request, i.e. request a copy of the user’s research ethics approval or proof of affiliation.
- Link to external service, i.e. Google Forms, payment service.
