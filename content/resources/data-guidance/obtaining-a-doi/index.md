## How do I get a DOI for my dataset?

<br>

1. Through the collection’s custodial organisation:

   - Identify the collection’s custodial organisation – a university or research organisation that funded, sponsored, published, approved, or has a current or historical stakeholder interest in the research project that collected the data.
    
   - In many cases, contacting the university library about getting a DOI for a dataset is a good starting point. Alternatively, an enquiry may be made with the research repository of the custodial organisation regarding options for getting a DOI.<br>
   An example of a collection DOI obtained via the university library is Sydney Speaks at ANU, which can be viewed here: [Sydney Speaks DOI landing page](https://datacommons.anu.edu.au/DataCommons/rest/display/anudc:6184?layout=def:display). ANU Library administers and manages the landing pages for ANU DOIs.

2. If the above does not suit the context of the dataset, and the dataset has not been published before, consider depositing it in a data repository like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), a multi-disciplinary open repository that automatically assigns a DOI to uploaded datasets and publications and hosts landing pages. Zenodo is a proponent of FAIR Principles and open science; however, it allows upload of data with different access levels: Open, Closed, Restricted, and Embargoed - read the [Zenodo General Policies](https://about.zenodo.org/policies/), [Terms of Use](https://about.zenodo.org/terms/), and [FAQs](https://help.zenodo.org/). The Zenodo DOI landing page can contain a link to point researchers to the data content in LDaCA.
