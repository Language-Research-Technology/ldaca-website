## Download Individual Files

Files from a collection can be downloaded from two locations:
- the File section of an Object page
- the File page for the selected item.

<br>

To download a file from an Object page, navigate to the _Files_ section at the end of the page (ensuring you click on the arrow to expand the relevant file) and select ___Download File___ on the right-hand side of the file entry.
