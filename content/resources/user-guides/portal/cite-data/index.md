<br>

Follow this guide when you need to cite a data source that you accessed through the {{< glossary_link display="LDaCA" id="ldaca" >}} portal in a publication.

<br>

## Citing a Collection

<br>

Cite the {{< glossary_link display="collection" id="collection" >}} as a whole whenever you use, or need to refer to, any part of it in your work, unless otherwise stated in the citation information provided in the LDaCA portal.

You can find each collection’s citation information on the collection level page under "How to cite this collection". The collection level page is the webpage presented upon selection of the collection name from the portal homepage or from a list of search results. Note that this citation information is separate from the _Citation_ {{< glossary_link display="metadata" id="metadata" >}} field that appears in some collections and refers to published papers about the collection.

<!--TODO add screenshot when we have this functionality-->

The citation information is not in any specific format or style (e.g. APA, MLA); it is meant to provide the essential citation elements for a minimal bibliographic reference (Tromsø Recommendations 2019) which are:

<br>

`Author, Date, Title, Publisher, Locator`

<br>

However, the citation information given may be what the {{< glossary_link display="data steward" id="data-steward" >}} had approved or had specified in the {{< glossary_link display="data license" id="data-license" >}}.

For the definitions of the above and additional citation elements, and further advice on citing linguistic data, refer to [The Tromsø Recommendations for Citation of Research Data in Linguistics](/citation/tromso-recommendations.pdf).

<br>

## Citing Parts of a Collection

<br>

You can mention particular parts of the {{< glossary_link display="collection" id="collection" >}} (e.g. objects, files, accompanying materials) you used in the text of your work, accompanied by the in-text citation e.g. Author, Date (or equivalent footnote if using a numbered style).

Note that the manner of citing a collection would most likely be subject to the context of your research project, and guidance from your school or publisher may take precedence over the information provided here.

<br>

## Citing Published Work

<br>

Descriptive {{< glossary_link display="metadata" id="metadata" >}} at the collection level may include a _Citation_ field that contains a link to, or citation information for, a published work. The published work is typically also authored by the {{< glossary_link display="data collection" id="data-collection" >}} creator and explains the research work and processes behind the collection of the data. LDaCA provides this information as specified by the data collection creator. In cases like this, cite the publication in addition to citing the data collection.

As an example, the COrpus of Oz Early English (COOEE) shows a Citation field with a link to the thesis that explains the research concepts, planning, protocols, processes etc. in the creation of the COOEE collection. The user should cite both the collection and the thesis.

<br>

## Citing LDaCA as Access Source

<br>

If you discovered or accessed the {{< glossary_link display="data collection" id="data-collection" >}} that you used in your work through the LDaCA portal, please cite or acknowledge LDaCA as follows:

> Data accessed via the Language Data Commons of Australia data portal https://data.ldaca.edu.au on [yyyy-mm-dd]. (The Language Data Commons of Australia is a nationally funded partnership project by the Australian Research Data Commons, The University of Queensland, Australian National University, The University of Melbourne, The University of Sydney, Monash University, First Languages Australia and AARNet).
