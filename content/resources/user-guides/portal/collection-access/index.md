## Apply for Access to Collections with Access Restrictions

When viewing an item that has restricted access, you will see one of the following permission warnings, depending on whether or not you are logged in to the portal:
- You do not have permission to see these files. Sign up or Login
- You do not have permission to see these files. You are logged in and you can apply for permission to view these files apply for access or refresh permissions

<br>

The LDaCA environment uses {{< glossary_link display="CADRE" id="cadre" >}} for access control. Once you have logged in to the {{< glossary_link display="LDaCA" id="ldaca" >}} portal (see [Login](/resources/user-guides/portal/login/) for further details), select ___apply for access___ in the warning text and you will be directed to the {{< glossary_link display="CADRE" id="cadre" >}} login page in a new tab.

<br>

<br>

Select ___Login___ and follow the CILogon prompts (see [Login](/resources/user-guides/portal/login/) again). Once logged in, you will be able to complete the data license form and request access. {{< glossary_link display="Data licensing" id="data-license" >}} is the mechanism used in {{< glossary_link display="CADRE" id="cadre" >}} for {{< glossary_link display="data stewards" id="data-steward" >}} to grant or deny legal permission to access and use data. Follow [this guide for applicants](https://documentation.cadre.ada.edu.au/guides/applicants/introduction) to learn more about navigating CADRE. 

<br>

Once the data sharing request is approved, navigate back to the data {{< glossary_link display="object" id="object" >}} you require in the LDaCA portal. If the warning text is still displayed, click on ___refresh permissions___. The page will update and you should be able to access the data. Note that these permissions apply to other data objects in the {{< glossary_link display="collection" id="collection" >}} that are covered by the same license terms; you do not need to apply for permission for each data object.

<br>

## View your Current Access List

To view your current list of licenses you have access to, hover your cursor over the arrow next to your account name to trigger a dropdown menu and select ___User Information___. If you are not logged in, see the steps under [Login](/resources/user-guides/portal/login/). The _User Memberships_ section shows your current access list, and you can click ___Check Memberships___ to refresh this list. You can also select ___Verify your access in CADRE___ to log into {{< glossary_link display="CADRE" id="cadre" >}}.
