> This section is not a how-to guide for Applicants but informs Owners and Handlers what the application process looks like from the Applicant's point of view. LDaCA Portal users and potential Applicants can refer to [Apply for Access to Collections with Access Restrictions](/resources/user-guides/portal/collection-access/#apply-for-access-to-collections-with-access-restrictions) on how to use {{< glossary_link display="REMS" id="rems" >}}.

## How a New User Typically Encounters LDaCA REMS

- When a user on the [LDaCA Portal](https://data.ldaca.edu.au) attempts to access a data {{< glossary_link display="object" id="object" >}} with restrictions, the following warning text displays on the webpage: "You do not have permission to see these files. Sign up or login." This means the user is not logged in to the portal and is prompted to do so.

<br>

- If the user was already logged in at the time of trying to access restricted data, the warning text is a bit different: "You are logged in and you can apply for permission to view these files. Apply for access or refresh permissions"

<br>

- An Applicant wishing to check the status of their application can click on the link in email notifications to be taken to the LDaCA REMS login page and the application form.

<br>

- **Save as draft**: The application remains a draft and cannot be seen by the Handlers. The Applicant can continue working on the application, or delete it completely from the system.
- **Submit application**: The application is sent to the Handlers and cannot be edited anymore unless specifically requested by the Handler.
- **Delete draft**: Deletes the application from the system.
- **Copy as a new application**: Allows the Applicant to re-apply after the Handler has returned the application for amendment.
- **PDF**: Produces a PDF of the summary of an application. Information includes the Application number, name of the resource and license, and the Events list.
