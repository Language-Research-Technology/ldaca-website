##### [Follow Login Prompts](#follow-login-prompts)

##### [Log in to LDaCA REMS via Account > User Information](#log-in-to-ldaca-rems-via-account--user-information)

<br>

Users log in to LDaCA {{< glossary_link display="REMS" id="rems" >}} in different ways:

- **Follow login prompts**: typical for LDaCA Portal visitors and potential data users

  - Upon selecting a data {{< glossary_link display="object" id="object" >}} with access restrictions, follow the login prompts presented on the webpage.

- **Login via Account > User Information**: typical for returning users

  - Log in to the LDaCA Portal
  - Then log in to LDaCA REMS via a link in their account's **_User Information_**.

- **Login via [rems.ldaca.edu.au/applications](https://rems.ldaca.edu.au/applications)**: seasoned users can go directly to the LDaCA REMS login page

<br>

The first two options are explained in detail below.

<br>

## Follow Login Prompts

<br>

### Log in to the LDaCA Portal via Prompt

Upon selecting a data {{< glossary_link display="object" id="object" >}} with access restrictions in the [LDaCA Portal](https://data.ldaca.edu.au), the following alert text appears:

{{< image Src="/user-guides/rems/REMS-SignUp-or-Login.png" Alt="LDaCA Portal: Sign Up or Login" Desc="LDaCA Portal: Sign Up or Login" Title="LDaCA Portal: Sign Up or Login" Ref="LDaCA" >}}

<br>

- Select **_Sign Up or Login_**
- The _LDaCAData_ sign in window appears; select **_SIGN IN WITH CILOGON_**

{{< image Src="/user-guides/rems/LDaCAData_SignInWithCILogon.png" Alt="LDaCAData: Sign In with CILogon" Desc="LDaCAData: Sign In with CILogon" Title="LDaCAData: Sign In with CILogon" Ref="LDaCA" >}}

<br>

You will be taken to CILogon's login page:

{{< image Src="/user-guides/rems/LDaCAData-CILogon-LoginPage.png" Alt="CILogon: Login Page" Desc="CILogon: Login Page" Title="CILogon: Login Page" Ref="LDaCA" >}}

<br>

> CILogon is a tool that allows you to use existing login credentials, so you do not have to create a new one.

- On the _CILogon_ page are two sections:
  - **Consent to Attribute Release**: Lists the kind of information CILogon requires of you.
  - **Select an Identity Provider**: Defaults to {{< glossary_link display="ORCID" id="orcid" >}}, but lets you choose a different ID provider from a drop-down list.
- If you are a researcher with an active ORCID account, you can log in with ORCID as the ID Provider.

> An ORCID account can only be used to log in if the email associated with it is set to public in your ORCID profile. Use another login option if you prefer to keep your email private.

- Alternatively, if you are a faculty, staff or student member of a university or college, find and select your institution's name from the drop-down list.

> If your university or school is not in the ID providers list, you can contact help@cilogon.org to request that your educational institution be added. Other account options include Google, {{< glossary_link display="GitHub" id="github" >}} or Microsoft. Remember which account you used as REMS keeps a history of actions per account.

<br>

> If using an Australia-based account, the AAF (Australian Access Federation) window may appear; see the AAF-UQ example image below. Select **_Click to login_** or wait for it to direct you to your selected institution's login page.

{{< image Src="/user-guides/rems/AAF-IdentityProvider.png" Alt="AAF Identity Provider" Desc="AAF Identity Provider" Title="AAF Identity Provider" Ref="LDaCA" >}}

<br>

- You will be taken to the ID Provider's login page; proceed to log in.
- After successfully logging in, you will be taken back to the data object page in the LDaCA Portal.

<br>

### Log in to LDaCA REMS via Prompt

When the user is logged in and attempts to access a restricted data {{< glossary_link display="object" id="object" >}}, the following alert text appears:

{{< image Src="/user-guides/rems/REMS-ApplyOrRefreshPermissions.png" Alt="LDaCA Portal: Apply For Access or Refresh Permissions" Desc="LDaCA Portal: Apply For Access or Refresh Permissions" Title="LDaCA Portal: Apply For Access or Refresh Permissions" Ref="LDaCA">}}

<br>

- Select **_Apply for access_** if you have not previously applied for permissions, i.e. a use license for this data object.
- Select **_refresh permissions_** if you have already applied for permissions ({{< glossary_link display="data license" id="data-license" >}}). The alert will remain the same if your application has not been approved. If your application was approved, you will see the green alert message similar to this:

{{< image Src="/user-guides/rems/REMS-AccessGranted.png" Alt="LDaCA Portal: Access to Data Granted" Desc="LDaCA Portal: Access to Data Granted" Title="LDaCA Portal: Access to Data Granted" Ref="LDaCA">}}

<br>

> LDaCA REMS remembers which data objects you have been granted access permissions for. When you log in again and access the data at a later time, the green alert text above will appear.
