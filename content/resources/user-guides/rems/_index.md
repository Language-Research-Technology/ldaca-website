The Resource Entitlement Management System (REMS) is a tool for managing access rights to resources, such as research datasets (CSC-IT Center for Science, 2017). These pages outline the procedures for performing user tasks in REMS as implemented in the LDaCA environment (LDaCA REMS). Through LDaCA REMS, Resource Owners/data stewards can manage access and license approval processes, and data end users can log in to apply for permissions.
