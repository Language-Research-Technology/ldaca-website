<br>

## Template

For {{< glossary_link display="collections" id="collection" >}} where there are a lot of interconnected {{< glossary_link display="objects" id="object" >}} and files, it may be easier or preferable to add the {{< glossary_link display="metadata" id="metadata" >}} for these via converting a spreadsheet to an {{< glossary_link display="RO-Crate" id="ro-crate" >}} in {{< glossary_link display="Crate-O" id="crate-o" >}}, rather than adding these items manually. An RO-Crate metadata spreadsheet template can be downloaded below and populated with metadata specific to your collection:

<br>

<a href="./ro-crate-metadata-template.xlsx" rel="" style="font-weight: bold; border: solid; border-radius: 23px; padding: 12px">ro-crate-metadata-template.xlsx</a>

<br>

> This template can be edited in [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/excel), [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) or [Google Sheets](https://google.com/sheets). It is not compatible with Apple Numbers.

The template is based on an example {{< glossary_link display="data collection" id="data-collection" >}} that contains three types of files within each object:

- Audio files (WAV), the primary material
- Text files (CSV), transcriptions of the audio files
- ELAN files (EAF), linguistic annotations of the audio files

> Spreadsheet conversion currently only has functionality to add new data, and cannot overwrite or edit existing data in your RO-Crate.

<br>

## Metadata Schemas

The spreadsheet uses a number of standard vocabularies for terms. Namespaces such as `ldac` and `pcdm` are prefixed to some {{< glossary_link display="metadata" id="metadata" >}} in the sections below - this is to:

- indicate that the term is not a part of the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary which RO-Crate is based on, but uses another namespace
- avoid overlaps where multiple schemas have the same term but differing usages and definitions.

In {{< glossary_link display="Crate-O" id="crate-o" >}}, these prefixes are hidden for legibility.

<br>

If your collection requires metadata terms that are not present in the template, check if an existing term fits from the schemas below.

- [Schema.org](https://schema.org/): No prefix needed, e.g. `description`.
- [Language Data Commons Schema Terms](https://w3id.org/ldac/terms) (Can also be browsed through the [Metadata for Language Data GitBook](https://ldaca.gitbook.io/metadata-for-language-data)): Add the prefix `ldac`, e.g. `ldac:interviewer`.
- [Dublin Core Metadata Terms](http://purl.org/dc/terms): Add the prefix `dct`, e.g. `dct:rightsHolder`.

If you have terms specific to your collection that aren't covered by the above schemas, see the [Custom Terms](#custom-terms) tab on how to use them.

<br>

## Tab Breakdown

The spreadsheet has the below tabs by default, but depending on your {{< glossary_link display="collection" id="collection" >}}, you may need to add additional tabs, or others may not be applicable.

<br>

| Tab          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RootDataset  | {{< glossary_link display="Metadata" id="metadata" >}} about the root or top level of the collection. Unlike the other tabs, the header for the root dataset is vertical rather than horizontal.                             |
| @context     | Specifies the vocabulary or schema that is intended to be used with language data.                                                                                                                                           |
| Custom Terms | Specifies any terms used that are specific to the collection and not part of other existing metadata schemas.                                                                                                                |
| Authors      | Metadata about the person or organisation responsible for creating this collection.                                                                                                                                          |
| Publishers   | Metadata about the organisation responsible for releasing this collection.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Licenses     | Metadata about the license(s) within the collection, both for the {{< glossary_link display="objects" id="object" >}} and files.                                                                                             |
| Provenance   | Metadata about the documented history or chain of custody of materials from their creation to their current location within a collection.                                                                                    |
| People       | Metadata about the people within the collection.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Places       | Metadata about the places within the collection.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Localities   | Metadata about the geometric location data within the collection.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Objects      | Metadata about the entities within the collection that could encompass one or more files.                                                                                                                                    |
| Files        | Metadata about the files in your collection. If the collection has multiple file formats that you prefer to track separately, duplicate this tab and add the formats to the tab names, e.g. CSV_Files, EAF_Files, WAV_Files. |
| Schemas      | Metadata about the schemas within the collection, for example, the set of columns used in tabular CSV files.                                                                                                                 |
| Columns      | Metadata about the columns within the CSV files in the collection.                                                                                                                                                           |

> ELAN (.eaf) files can have relative or absolute paths to the data they relate to. The ELAN preferences file is generally not needed for the collection and relates to the particular ELAN user only.

<br>

### Examples in the Template

Below the header, at least one example row is included to illustrate how the section can be filled. This is colour-coded according to whether the column:

- requires the user to manually input data (<span style="color:dodgerblue">blue</span>)
- is pre-filled with a formula or static value and doesn't require editing (<span style="color:green">green</span>)
- is for internal use and doesn't require editing in most cases (<span style="color:orangered">orange</span>).

> HINT: Highlight the example row and drag it down to copy all the pre-filled cells. Remember to remove the example rows before you convert your spreadsheet in {{< glossary_link display="Crate-O" id="crate-o" >}}!

The columns provided in the template tabs are illustrative only and may not all apply to your collection; please edit these as needed.
Where a column header begins with a full stop `.`, this indicates that the column will be ignored when the data is loaded into Crate-O and will not appear in the {{< glossary_link display="RO-Crate" id="ro-crate" >}}. This can be helpful if you want to retain other information in your spreadsheet that may not be in a format applicable to the RO-Crate.

<br>

At a minimum, itâ€™s best practice to include `@id` and `@type` columns in each of your spreadsheet tabs, as these appear in Crate-O for each of the entities. The tables in the next sections provide further detail on what constitutes a valid `@id` and `@type` in each tab.

> HINT: To type a column name beginning with `@` in Excel, put an apostrophe before it `'@`. This will force it to be recognised as a text value rather than a formula.

<br>

## Column Breakdown

The section below describes each of the columns included in the template, ordered by tab. Please note that the columns provided in the template tabs are illustrative only and should be edited according to the requirements of your {{< glossary_link display="collection" id="collection" >}}.

<br>

### RootDataset

The root dataset tab provides information about the top level of the {{< glossary_link display="collection" id="collection" >}}. Unlike the other tabs, the root dataset tab lists items row by row and can only have one column, so if there are rows that require more than one value (like `@type`), duplicate that row.

| Column                | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| @id                   | Data entry | Persistent, managed unique ID in URL format (if available), for example, a {{< glossary_link display="DOI" id="doi" >}} for a collection. The default for this field is `./` indicating a relative path to your current directory, however, if you already have a persistent ID for the collection, it can be added in this field instead. |
| @type                 | Pre-filled | The type of the collection. Both `Dataset` and `RepositoryCollection` are required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| name                  | Data entry | The name of this collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| description           | Data entry | An abstract of the collection. Include as much detail as possible about the motivation and use of the dataset, including things that we do not yet have properties for.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ldac:doi              | Data entry | A Digital Object Identifier, e.g. https://doi.org/10.1000/182.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| isRef_author          | Pre-filled | Generated from the `@id` column in the [Authors](#authors) tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| isRef_publisher       | Pre-filled | Generated from the `@id` column in the [Publishers](#publishers) tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| isRef_license         | Pre-filled | Generated from the `@id` column in the [Licenses](#licenses) tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| datePublished         | Data entry | The date the object was published. The date should be in the ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| inLanguage            | Data entry | The language in which the resource is written. For example, a work about the Italian language as used in Australia (`ldac:subjectLanguage`) that is written in English (`inLanguage`).                                                                                                                                                     |
| ldac:subjectLanguage  | Data entry | The languages that the materials in the collection are about (not the language that it is in). For example, a work about the Italian language as used in Australia (`ldac:subjectLanguage`) that is written in English (`inLanguage`).                                                                                                     |
| ldac:metadataIsPublic | Data entry | Determines whether the collection {{< glossary_link display="metadata" id="metadata" >}} can be viewed publicly.

> The prefix `isRef_` indicates that data in this column should be taken from another `@id` field in the spreadsheet. For example, `isRef_author` uses the `@id` from the Author tab to link all the author details to the RootDataset tab.

<br>

### @context

The context specifies the vocabulary or schema that is intended to be used with the collection. In the case of language data, the [Language Data Commons Schema (ldac)](https://w3id.org/ldac/terms) is used. This is also the place to specify the schema for [Custom Terms](#custom-terms) if these occur in your collection.

| Column | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name   | Pre-filled | The name of the vocabulary or schema. The template is pre-filled with the `ldac` schema, which is required for this template. If your collection has [Custom Terms](#custom-terms), keep the second row with `custom`. |
| @id    | Pre-filled | Persistent, managed unique ID in URL format of the vocabulary or schema. If your collection has [Custom Terms](#custom-terms), keep the second row with `arcp://name,custom/terms#`.                                   |

<br>

### Custom Terms

If you have terms specific to your collection that aren't covered by the existing [Metadata Schemas](#metadata-schemas), use the custom terms tab to add them.

#### Using Custom Terms on Other Tabs

Once you've listed your custom terms, these can be used throughout the spreadsheet in the following ways:

- Properties: as column headers in the format `custom:yourProperty`
- Defined Terms: as column values under their related custom property in the format `custom:YourDefinedTerm`

> Defined Term Sets are only required in the Custom Terms tab to group a set of Defined Terms and don't need to be used elsewhere in the spreadsheet.

### Licenses

A license for a {{< glossary_link display="collection" id="collection" >}} establishes the conditions for who can access, share and reuse the data, and other conditions as required. It is a legal arrangement between the creator of the data and the end-user specifying what users can do with the data.

| Column              | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| @id                 | Data entry | A URL to a version of the license (if available), for example, a URL of a Creative Commons license. For custom licenses (i.e. those specific to a particular collection), it is recommended that a copy of the license file be included in the repository to ensure that it remains accessible. `license.txt` or similar should be added as the `@id`. |
| @type               | Pre-filled | The type of license. `ldac:DataReuseLicense` is required for all items, and `File` should also be added for physical licenses in the collection as `[ldac:DataReuseLicense, File]`.                                                                                                                                                                    |

| isRef_isPartOf      | Pre-filled | Specifies the collection that the license is a part of, generated from the `@id` column in the [RootDataset](#rootdataset) tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It is possible to leave the {{< glossary_link display="licensing" id="licensing" >}} tab blank if these details are still being finalised for the collection, however, this will need to be amended later in {{< glossary_link display="Crate-O" id="crate-o" >}}.

> If there are any additional usage restrictions or options for use outside of a given license, this information can be included in a `usageInfo` field, e.g. "For any use not permitted by the CC-BY-ND 4.0 License, please contact the Data Steward".

### Files

A file is a container for data and can store data in different formats. A single {{< glossary_link display="object" id="object" >}} could have an audio file as well as a text file containing a transcription of the audio. Three examples of file types are included in the template: CSV, EAF and WAV.

### Schemas

If you have tabular CSV files in your collection, a schema allows you to define tabular formats for the tables used within the collection, which are further detailed in the [Columns](#columns) tab.

| Column           | Type       | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @id              | Data entry | A unique identifier for the schema. Identifiers should be prefixed with `#`. |
| @type            | Pre-filled | The type of the schema. Only `csvw:Schema` is valid.                         |
| name             | Data entry | The name of the schema.                                                      |
| isRef_conformsTo | Data entry | A standard that the schema follows. Only `tabulatorMapping` is valid.        |

<br>

### Columns

If you have tabular CSV files in your collection with multiple columns, this tab allows you to identify the columns within your data as well as provide definitions for them. This allows users to see at a glance what is contained within the CSV files through the metadata and HTML preview, rather than having to open the files individually.

| Column                 | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @id                    | Pre-filled | A unique identifier for the column, generated from the `name` column. Identifiers should be prefixed with `#col_`.                                         |
| @type                  | Pre-filled | The type of the entity. Only `csvw:Column` is valid.                                                                                                       |
| name                   | Data entry | The name of the column. Avoid using spaces, as this is also used to generate the `@id`.                                                                    |
| description            | Data entry | A definition of the column.                                                                                                                                |
| csvw:propertyUrl       | Data entry | If any of the columns map directly to another schema term, use this field to provide the unique identifier of that term, otherwise leave this field blank. |
| isReverse_csvw:columns | Data entry | The `@id` of the schema to which this column relates from the [Schemas](#schemas) tab.                                                                     |
