<br>

This guide takes you through the steps to create an RO-Crate metadata file, using a top-level collection for language data as an example.

<br>

## Open Directory

- Open [Crate-O](https://language-research-technology.github.io/crate-o/#/) in a compatible browser.
- In the [Main Menu](/resources/user-guides/crate-o/basic-navigation/#main-menu), select ___Open Directory___.
- Navigate to a folder where the RO-Crate will be saved, or create a new one, then confirm your selection.
- For the pop-up message asking _Let site view files?_, select ___View Files___.
- Your current working directory will be displayed in the _Selected Directory_ section in the [Mode Selector](/resources/user-guides/crate-o/basic-navigation/#mode-selector).

<br>

## Select Mode

- In the [Mode Selector](/resources/user-guides/crate-o/basic-navigation/#mode-selector), the ___Mode___ dropdown shows the current mode that is being displayed, i.e. the metadata framework associated with your collection.
- Change the mode from the default _Simple RO-Crate Dataset_ to _Language Data Commons top-level Collection (corpus)_.

<br>

## Add Entity Metadata

- The [Current Entity](/resources/user-guides/crate-o/basic-navigation/#current-entity) section shows your location in the current RO-Crate.
- The [Property Groups](/resources/user-guides/crate-o/basic-navigation/#property-groups) panel allows you to navigate allows you to navigate to the various groups associated with your RO-Crate.
- The [Entity Properties](/resources/user-guides/crate-o/basic-navigation/#entity-properties) panel is where you can add data about your collection.
- For blank RO-Crates, the following missing property messages will appear by default. Clicking the blue ___Add___ buttons will automatically add these missing items to your RO-Crate.

- Enter the entity properties you have for your collection. Add as little or as much information about your collection as you like, as this can be saved and worked on further later. To browse all the metadata entities associated with the Language Data Commons Mode, see [Metadata for Language Data](https://ldaca.gitbook.io/metadata-for-language-data).

<br>

## Save RO-Crate

- In the [Main Menu](/resources/user-guides/crate-o/basic-navigation/#main-menu), select ___Save___.
- For the pop-up message asking _Save changes to [Selected Directory]?_, select ___Save changes___.
- Your RO-Crate is now successfully saved!

<br>

### Required Properties

After saving, if there are required properties missing from your RO-Crate, the section _Saved with warnings_ will appear. You can select the dropdown on this message to view the missing required properties. Clicking on one of these warnings will take you to the relevant property group. If you choose to edit any of these sections, select ___Save___ again to ensure your most recent changes are not lost.

## Append Data from Spreadsheet

If you have a spreadsheet in a compatible format that you want to add to your collection to assist with metadata description, select ___Bulk Add___ in the [Main Menu](/resources/user-guides/crate-o/basic-navigation/#main-menu) and load the spreadsheet. This will append it to your existing RO-Crate. Note that this option currently only has functionality to add new data, rather than overwrite edited data that is already present in your RO-Crate.
