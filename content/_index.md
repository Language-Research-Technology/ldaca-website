<h1>The Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) will make nationally significant language data available for academic and non-academic use and provide a model for ensuring continued access with appropriate community control.</h1>

<div class="container">
  <p style="width: 40%;">
    Australia is a massively multilingual country in one of the worldâ€™s most
    linguistically diverse regions. Significant collections of this intangible
    cultural heritage have been amassed, including collections of Australian
    Indigenous languages, regional languages of the Pacific, and of Australian
    English, as well as collections important for cyber-security and for
    emergency communication. LDaCA will integrate this existing work into a
    national research infrastructure while also securing collections which remain
    under-utilised or at risk. LDaCA will thus ensure long-lasting access for
    analysis and reuse of these invaluable data, and will manage the data in a
    culturally, ethically and legally appropriate manner guided by FAIR and CARE
    principles.

  <h3>To accomplish these goals, LDaCA will:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Develop a comprehensive language data access policy framework,</li>
    <li>Develop shared technical infrastructure and standards across institutions,</li>
    <li>Build a sustainable long-term repository for ingesting and curating existing
    language data collections of national significance, and</li>
    <li>Build a portal for discovery and access of language data.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The result will be an integrated national technical infrastructure to analyse
language collections at scale which will open up the social and economic
possibilities of Australia's rich linguistic heritage. The project will build
connections to other HASS RDC projects and assist in laying the foundation
for the establishment of a broader HASS Research Data Commons as well as
positioning Australia internationally as a leading contributor of language
collections and digital infrastructure.
