fieldwork – a community outsider working with a smaller language community
located far from an urban centre. For my postgraduate research, I documented
and described grammatical topics of
<a href=https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sude1239 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Sudest</a> (known as Vanga
Vanatɨna by its speakers), an Oceanic language spoken in Papua New Guinea (PNG
). The language is spoken on the islands of Vanatinai (also known as Sudest
and Tagula) and Yeina in the Louisiade Archipelago, approximately 350
kilometres southeast of the PNG mainland. In the following, I discuss
decisions I made and processes I followed related to the collection of
language data and archiving the resulting corpus of texts, including ethical
considerations, ownership of the data, data formats, metadata, and data
security and reuse. This is by no means meant as a guide (of best practice)
for projects where language data are being collected with speakers of un(der)
described languages. Rather, it is an account of some of the types of
considerations and procedures that need to be considered when collecting
language data and how I handled them in this instance.</p><p><data id=id-3 data-raw></data>
<data id=id-4 data-raw></data></p><p>Before recording with a speaker for the first time, I would explain the
project to the speaker and their rights as contributors to the project. I
would explain how I would use the language recordings, how they would be
stored and accessed and how speakers of the language or other researchers
might access and use the recordings in the future. This included discussing
how they, the person(s) making the recording, would retain ownership over the
recording (i.e., intellectual and cultural property rights). They would also
be the ones to choose access rights over the text and have the option to
withdraw any or all recordings they made from the corpus at any point (more
on these below). After these discussions, if the speaker was still interested
in the project, I would then record an oral consent form with them. The
consent form was in English, the language of wider communication in the
province. In cases where the speaker didn’t speak or spoke limited English,
we would have a translator present for this process. I chose to use an oral
consent form as it is accessible to all participants no matter their literacy
levels. It also has the advantage of being a more durable format compared
with a paper consent form, particularly when working in a hot and humid
climate and it can also be easily backed up.</p><p><data id=id-5 data-raw></data>
<data id=id-6 data-raw></data></p><p>Each time I made a recording with a speaker or speakers, I played the
recording back to them to check that they were happy with the recording and
so that they could decide on what sort of access conditions they wanted the
archived recording to have. If the speaker was not satisfied with the
recording, sometimes they would choose to make another recording and delete
the original or simply delete the recording and maybe try again later. If
they were happy with the recording, they would decide on the access
conditions they wanted for the archived recording. The possibilities ranged
from the most restricted, being that only I, as the original researcher,
could access the recordings and use them for my research, to the opposite end
of the access continuum where anyone interested could download and listen to
the recordings, read any transcriptions, and potentially use them for
educational or research purposes. In between these two ends of the continuum,
they could opt for other access conditions such as only allowing access for
registered users of the archive, or only for researchers and speakers, or
just for speakers. They could also choose to have a text embargoed for a
certain period of time.</p><p><data id=id-7 data-raw></data>
<data id=id-8 data-raw></data></p><p>When I was preparing my ethics application for the university, I applied and
received ethics approval to work with minors. I didn’t plan to collect data
from children (although I did want the option of recording older teens if any
showed an interest in recording), but included minors in my ethics
application because of the potential for children to be inadvertently filmed,
for example if they walk into frame or come up to a parent while the parent
is being recorded. The ethics approval meant that if such instances arose
during a recording, the recording could still be kept and archived (
assuming approval from the speaker making the recording). While such
situations didn’t end up arising during my own data collection, this would
not have been an ideal fix for this issue. More widely, as a discipline, we
don’t have good model(s) regarding how we deal with such scenarios in regards
to access and consent. One suggestion I heard was to only make such
recordings openly available after obtaining informed consent from any
children involved after they turned 18 but, for most circumstances, such an
approach is unlikely to be realistic.</p><p>As the researcher who collected the data and deposited it in the archive, I
am the person the archive contacts when someone puts in a request to access
restricted data. But granting any access to data, whether restricted or not,
is based on the wishes of the owner(s) of a specific text, that is, the
speaker(s) who recorded it. As mentioned, the speaker(s) retains ownership of
the text and intellectual and cultural property rights over the recording.
They also retain the right to change access restrictions on a recording or
remove it completely from the archived corpus at any point and request that
it not be used in any future research from that point forwards (given it
would be difficult or impossible to remove excerpts from recordings in
previously submitted or published work on the language, this is not something
that is generally done). Away from the field, this can get a bit complicated
due to limited telephone and internet coverage in the islands although it is
increasingly more feasible as more and more people have access to mobile
telephones and apps like WhatsApp and Facebook. Any future users of the
corpus who download data from the archive must agree to only use the data for
educational or research purposes and not for (direct) financial gain. Having
said that, it needs to be acknowledged that researchers including myself can
and do benefit indirectly from such data collections in the form of
scholarships, grants, qualifications, and other potential employment
opportunities related to our work with the language. Although I, like many (
hopefully most) fellow linguists, subscribe to the idea that the source of
the data, that is the speaker(s), should have control over their own
recordings, the current systems we have set up make that hard or impossible
to implement. This is a problem that is increasingly being acknowledged and
we as a community of researchers don’t currently have answers for it. Each
speaker community is different and so one-size-fits-all models for
communities are unlikely to work.</p><p>When collecting spoken or signed language data, the best practice is to make
audio and video recordings in formats that are ‘lossless’ rather than ‘lossy
’. Lossless compression allows for perfect reconstruction of the original data
. Lossy formats reduce file size but also discard some information that
cannot be reconstructed which is obviously not an ideal outcome for precious
language data! For audio recordings, I use a recorder that records Waveform
Audio File Format or WAV files (.wav) and for video recordings I record
Advanced Video Coding High Definition or AVCHD files (.mts) which are both
lossless formats and accepted by many archives. WAV files are also the audio
format needed for many linguistics software programs. AVCHD files are, however
, not a file type accepted by the archive where the Sudest corpus is housed
which only accepts MPEG video files (.mpg) which are lossy. This situation is
likely due to the fact that the archive was set up some two decades ago when
storage capacity was a big issue and the archive has not yet caught up in
this regard. This is not an ideal situation and something that should be
considered if you are able to choose the archive where your data will be
deposited. For derived data including text-audio aligned transcriptions and
translations as well as any other annotations, I use plain text (.txt) and
ELAN Annotation Format files (.eaf). The plain text files are the file type
created when working in the Field Linguist’s Toolbox software program and can
be opened, read, and edited in most text editors. It is also a good format
for storing information if you want it to persist. The EAF files are more
specialist although they are a transferable format. They are only created
and used with ELAN which is an annotation tool for audio and video widely
used by linguists. Both text and EAF files are some of the standard file
formats for transcriptions and annotations that are generally accepted by
language archives today.</p><p><data id=id-9 data-raw></data>
<data id=id-10 data-raw></data></p><p>When collecting metadata, I adopted the Component MetaData Infrastructure (
CMDI) schema used by the archive where I was planning to deposit my data. The
logistics of fieldwork can be overwhelming at times and following the archive’
s metadata schema meant I would minimally have the metadata required to
deposit the corpus. The schema was also practical in that there were some
fields that were obligatory (e.g., text title, creation data, country of
recording) but many fields are optional (e.g., speaker date of birth/age,
education level, address where recording took place). Having optional fields
that could be filled in or not worked well for me because collecting more
detailed information, particularly biographical information about speaker(s),
wasn’t always possible or appropriate. Not all speakers, particularly older
speakers, necessarily knew their date or year of birth and they may only know
their approximate age. Some speakers I only met when they came to make a
recording and getting the detailed biographic information one might like for
metadata records is not necessarily culturally appropriate, particularly
given the power imbalance between myself, an educated, white researcher from
Australia, and speakers I don’t have an established relationship with. Aside
from asking about where the speaker grew up, currently lived, and their
approximate age, if I didn’t already have an established relationship with
the individual, I tended to let information emerge incidentally as
volunteered rather than questioning them in depth. One topic I did discuss
with speakers regarding metadata was the question of authorship and
attribution of the recording and whether they wanted their name to be listed
or would like to be given a pseudonym. With small communities, especially
when you are recording audio and video of the speaker, complete anonymisation
is not really possible if the speaker also wants the recording to be
accessible to other speakers and this could be a potential issue. However, in
my experiences, (all) speakers chose to have their names listed as the author(s) of the text without anonymisation and were generally excited or proud to
be making a record of their language and knowledge.</p><p>While the amount of personal metadata collected for individual speakers varied, there was also situational data that I wish I had collected and didn’t. I
collected information including the date and location of the recording (e.g.,
the village and house where the recording took place), who was present at the
recording, the genre of recording (e.g., a historical narrative, conversation
, instructions on how to complete a specific task, etc.). One piece of
information that I didn’t include, for example, is the exact location of the
speaker and their orientation in space. Were they facing towards the north?
North-west? Since my original fieldwork, I have begun to research the use of
co-speech gestures in the language, that is, gestures that occur at the same
time as someone is speaking. Frequently, speakers point to real world
locations while they are talking but this can be hard to identify if you don’
t know exactly how the speaker was positioned in relation to where they are
gesturing. Luckily, by watching the videos I can still identify the direction
a speaker was facing and add this to the recording’s metadata but this would
be a very difficult if not impossible information for a future user of the
data to ascertain if they wanted to study gesture.</p><p>Data security is something I had to consider both in the field and at home.
In order to keep data secure on computers and storage devices, I made sure
that they were all password protected. In the field, I also had to consider
specific factors in the environment that could endanger the data - the major
issue is the humidity. The average humidity level on the island hovers around
80 percent year-round and I had paper notebooks, a computer, hard drives and
SD cards that I need to keep in working order in a house that is relatively
open to the outside environment with no glass windows and no electricity (I
do remember a field manual suggesting a fridge makes a good home for
equipment in humid environments if that is an option). To protect equipment,
I stored everything in waterproof pouches with silica sachets. I would
distribute backup USBs and SD cards across different pouches so if one failed
, I would hopefully have backups. I also tried to double bag equipment and
notes when travelling, particularly by boat. Boat transport in the islands is
either by traditional wooden sailing outrigger canoes or fibreglass dinghy ‘
banana’ boat, both of which are open to the elements.</p><p>To secure data, ideally, I would also make backup copies of all new
recordings and transcription files each day in the field. However, during my
first fieldtrip, I didn’t have access to a power source and therefore couldn’t charge my laptop meaning I couldn’t backup recordings. As this also meant I
was transcribing all texts using pencil and paper, I did photograph all new
transcriptions each night to preserve a backup copy. Towards the end of my
trip, I became quite worried about having no backups for recordings,
particularly when thinking about the boat trip back to the main island which
can take up to eight hours (or more in bad conditions). To avoid making this
trip with only the original copies, I tagged along on a walk to the local
primary school two and a half hours away because it was rumoured that one of
the teachers had a solar panel connected to a car battery and I would be able
to charge my laptop and therefore backup the recordings. All the community’s
primary school students make this walk twice a week, living at school during
the week. At one point in the journey, you have to cross a river in a small
outrigger canoe. It was quite alarming when the teenager paddling me across
nonchalantly pointed out a nearby crocodile while we were mid-river but at
least I managed to back up all the files! For subsequent fieldtrips, I
invested in a battery and solar panel for charging equipment and backing up
data although I still had to cross rivers with crocodiles from time to time.</p><p><data id=id-11 data-raw></data>
<data id=id-12 data-raw></data></p><p>In order to secure the corpus of texts into the future and make sure that it
doesn’t get lost on an old hard drive, I have uploaded it to a language
archive. The archive is a digital repository tasked with safeguarding
language corpora of languages for which there is limited documented
data. As well as keeping copies of the uploaded data, the archive will also
ensure that the data continues to be accessible, for example, by converting
data files to newer formats if the format a file was uploaded in becomes
obsolete. Having the corpus saved in an online archive also means that it is
discoverable for other researchers, speakers, and other interested parties.
It can be found through the search portal of the archive by searching by
language name(s), the contributor’s name, or by browsing by country. The
corpus can also be found by searching through the Open Language Archive
Community (OLAC) portal which is an online virtual library of information and
links to language resources available in a specific language (e.g., grammars,
dictionaries, archived texts). The information on OLAC is automatically
collected or ‘harvested’ daily from participating archives meaning that when
you upload a file to an archive, it will automatically be listed in OLAC the
next time it is updated. Because there is limited information online about
Sudest, keyword searches on most online search engines such as Google also
displays links to the corpus quite high up in the results.</p><p>It&rsquo;s often suggested that the researcher should make a will and assign a
literary executor for the data they collect. This raises the question about
who to nominate? As a graduate student, I nominated one of my supervisors as
the person to have direct access and editing powers over the archived corpus.
This makes sense in that, after myself, my supervisor is one of the people
that knows the most about the project and data collection. Supervisors are
also often the chief investigator for ethics approval for graduate data
collection as well. But supervisors tend to be older than graduate students
and don’t necessarily have any personal connection to the speaker community.
Ideally, any succession plan would bring control of the data back to the
community but what would that mean in practice? There may be issues both
political and practical if just one individual from the community becomes the
executor. In some cases, there may be an obvious option if the community has
a language and culture centre or registered Indigenous corporation. In such
cases, access and stewardship plans may have been discussed and incorporated
into the project since the beginning. For many communities, especially in the
Pacific, this is not the case and therefore there is no clear governing group
which might take such a task on.</p><p>In future research projects I might work in, I can build on my past
experiences and hopefully improve on them. This would likely involve
expanding the list of situational metadata I automatically collect for each
recording as well as considering the file types accepted by an archive when
deciding where to deposit any recordings. Although I’ve only touched briefly
on issues relating to speaker-community control and intellectual and cultural
property rights, I would also aim to build in more funding and space into the
timeline of a project for more equitable community consultation and
collaboration. Such discussion would then likely have a flow-on effect for
how to secure the data into the future. Ethical and practical questions
regarding data collection, access, and stewardship are complex. It is
impossible to take all contingencies into account. Best practice and
standards change with much of the change led by Indigenous and First Nations
researchers. Best practices from a decade ago are not those of today and this
is a good thing!</p><p><data id=id-13 data-raw></data>
